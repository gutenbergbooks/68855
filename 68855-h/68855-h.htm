<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>After the battle of Gettysburg in the East, and
the siege of Vicksburg in the West, attention was
riveted during the later summer and autumn of
1863 on the campaign around Chattanooga.
Seated on the heights along the southern border
of Tennessee, that city commanded highways
running through the very heart of the Confederacy.
The result at Gettysburg had demonstrated
that no Southern army could invade the
North; the Union victory at Vicksburg determined
that the Mississippi should run unhindered
to the sea. The battles of Chickamauga, Lookout
Mountain, and Missionary Ridge not only decided
that Kentucky and Tennessee should
remain in the Union, but they opened the way for
Sherman’s advance on Atlanta and his March to
the Sea, which cut the Confederacy in two and
made Lee’s surrender a necessity.</p>

<p>The War between the States saw no more stubborn
fighting than raged on September 19th and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
20th around the old Cherokee stronghold of
Chickamauga. Two months later, occurred the
three days’ battle around the hill city of Chattanooga.
In all these events, the citizen soldiers of
Wisconsin played a conspicuous part, which is
herein described by a participant and student of
these famous contests. In these battles the reputations
of officers were made and unmade, and
from them emerged the great generals who were
to carry the Union arms to complete victory—Thomas,
Sherman, Sheridan, and Grant.</p>

<p>Colonel Fitch, the author of this volume, began
his service July 16, 1861, as Sergeant-Major of
the Sixth Wisconsin; he was commissioned First-Lieutenant
in October following, and in the succeeding
April was appointed Adjutant of the
Twenty-first; he became, in succession, Major
and Lieutenant-Colonel of that regiment, and in
March, 1865, was brevetted Colonel of Volunteers
“for gallant and meritorious services during
the war.” He served chiefly with the Army of
Potomac, Army of Virginia, Army of Ohio, and
Army of Cumberland. He commanded his regiment
from July 1, 1864; and on the March to the
Sea; and in the Carolinas headed a wing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
brigade, consisting of the Twenty-first Wisconsin,
the Forty-second Indiana, and the One Hundred-and-fourth
Illinois. Later, he was assigned
to the command of the Second Brigade of the
Fourteenth Army Corps. He now lives at
Pueblo, Colorado.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<i>The Preliminary Campaign</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded
by Major-General William S. Rosecrans,
was, in June, 1863, encamped at Murfreesboro,
Tennessee, thirty-two miles south of Nashville.
It had been lying here since January 5,
1863, having marched from the adjacent field of
Stone’s River. The Confederate Army of the
Tennessee, was, at the same time, in camp near
Tullahoma, forty miles south of Murfreesboro.
The Confederates had been defeated at Stone’s
River, and had fallen back to Tullahoma at the
same time the Union forces had taken up their
camp at Murfreesboro.</p>

<p>I will designate the campaign of the latter army,
beginning on June 23, 1863, by marching from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Murfreesboro, as the “Chattanooga Campaign of
1863.” The various engagements in that campaign,
beginning with Hoover’s<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and Liberty gaps<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
on June 24, down to that of Missionary
Ridge, at Chattanooga, on November 25, are incidents
of that campaign, and necessary parts of
it. A description of the campaign immediately
preceding, which started when General Rosecrans
assumed command of the army of the Cumberland
at Bowling Green, Kentucky, in October,
1862, and ended with the victory of the Union
forces in the battle of Stone’s River, and the occupation
of Murfreesboro—would give a preliminary
historical setting.</p>

<p>In fact, a full history of the Chattanooga
campaign may well include the entire movements
of the army under General Buell, from
October 1, 1862, when it marched out of Louisville,
Kentucky, in pursuit of Bragg’s army.
The latter was then supposed to be in the vicinity
of Frankfort, the capital of that State, engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
in the inglorious occupation of coercing the legislature
to pass an ordinance of secession. It was
also trying to recruit its ranks from the young citizens
of Kentucky, and was restocking its commissary
from the rich farms of the blue-grass region.
Buell found it, on October 8, at Perryville,
seventy-five miles southeast of Louisville. He
drove it out of Kentucky, and then marched
to Bowling Green, on the railroad between Louisville
and Nashville, where in the same month he
was superseded, as commander, by Rosecrans.</p>

<p>The Atlanta campaign, immediately following
that of Chattanooga—beginning on May 4, 1864,
and ending in the capture of Atlanta on September
8 of that year—gives a subsequent historical
setting: a connection in time as well as in space,
to the operations of the Army of the Cumberland
in 1863. By referring to these several important
military campaigns of the war, the reader may obtain
a synchronous perspective of the most important
events in the Middle West, in the department
occupied by that army.</p>

<p>A larger setting can be given to this campaign
for the capture of Chattanooga, by framing it into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the two military fields of the Potomac on the east,
and the Tennessee on the west. The Army of
the Potomac was opposed to General Lee’s forces.
It operated generally between Washington,
D. C., and Richmond, Virginia, the latter being
the objective. At the time the Army of the
Cumberland marched out of Murfreesboro, Lee
had taken advantage of the defeat of the army
under Hooker from May 1 to 3, 1863, at Chancellorsville,
Virginia, and invaded Maryland and
Pennsylvania. He was decisively defeated in
the battle of Gettysburg, on July 3 following, by
Major-General George C. Meade, which closed
his campaigning into the North. The old field
north of Richmond was reoccupied by the Army
of the Potomac, then in command of Meade, as
successor to Hooker. It was the latter who, in
October, brought the Eleventh and Twelfth corps
from the Army of the Potomac to the Army of
the Cumberland, at Chattanooga.</p>

<p>On the west of the Army of the Cumberland,
was the field of the Army of the Tennessee. Its
task was the opening of the Mississippi River.
At this time, General U. S. Grant was in command,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
and had his army at Vicksburg. That
stronghold surrendered to him on July 4. Thus
the great river was opened. This left the greater
part of the Army of the Tennessee free to cooperate
in the autumn with the Army of the Cumberland
in the battles around Chattanooga; and from
that date to assist in the Atlanta campaign, and
the March to the Sea, the following year.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that victory crowned all
three of the great armies during the time of the
Chattanooga campaign. The confidence and discipline
of the Union forces, increased at this time;
the discovery, by the governing powers at Washington,
of those of the general officers who displayed
the most ability; the placing of such officers
in the command of the Union armies; and the
gradual weakening of the secession armies, were
the principal factors contributing to the final end
of the war. The resulting campaigns of 1864
and the early part of 1865, sufficed to crush the
most powerful rebellion in history.</p>

<p>During its long occupancy of Murfreesboro, the
Army of the Cumberland had been somewhat recruited;
its equipment was restored to its former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
condition; and it had also been very much improved,
as well as reorganized. During this time
the formidable Fortress Rosecrans was built at
Murfreesboro, so that a small force might continue
to hold the place after the army moved on.
This fort proved of great value during the
Hood campaign against Franklin and Nashville,
in November and December, 1864. Nashville
had to be permanently occupied. In fact, the
line of railway running from Louisville through
Kentucky and Tennessee to Chattanooga, through
Bowling Green, Nashville, Murfreesboro, Tullahoma,
and Bridgeport, formed the line for
carrying supplies, as well as the line of operations.
This line, about three hundred and forty
miles long, had to be defended and kept open, as
the Union Army advanced. As part of it—if
not the whole—lying in southern Kentucky and
Tennessee, was in the enemy’s country, it was
necessary to build and man as the army advanced,
a line of forts and block houses, for the protection
of this railroad from Nashville to Chattanooga.</p>

<p>By glancing at a good map, the reader can
see the immense difficulty involved in the maintenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
and defense of this line of supplies consisting
of but a single-track railroad. The task required
the services of about a fourth of the entire
army. The field of operations contained no
navigable rivers parallel with the line of advance,
upon which gunboats might assist the army in its
conflicts with the enemy, and by which the railroad
could be assisted in carrying supplies. Two
somewhat important streams traversed the field,
or rather ran at right angles to it—the Cumberland,
on which Nashville is located; and the
Tennessee, flowing past Chattanooga. These
run westward from the Cumberland Mountains,
and for very small craft plying for limited distances
only, were navigable within the field of the
Army of the Cumberland. But they were of
practically no use to the Union Army, except at
Chattanooga after its occupation—when for a
time, supplies were thus transported from Bridgeport
and Stevenson pending the repairing of the
railway from those places. There were also two
smaller streams in southern Tennessee, running at
right angles to the line of operation, called the
Duck and the Elk. It was necessary that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Union commander consider these in his advance
from Murfreesboro, for they were fordable only
in places, and not even there when floods were
rampant. They were bridged on the main wagon
roads, but these bridges were easily destroyed by
the enemy. In its campaigns from Louisville,
Kentucky, to Chattanooga, the Army of the
Cumberland did not have any assistance from the
navy.</p>

<p>In this sketch, it is not necessary to give a tedious
account of the most difficult natural obstacles,
such as streams, mountains, and distances. These
are apparent upon the study of any good map.
But mention must be made, that the Union Army
faced a chain of mountains lying between it and
Chattanooga, at the northwestern edge of which
then lay the Confederate Army. This is the
plateau of the Cumberland Mountains, extending
in a southwest direction from West Virginia to
northern Alabama, and covering what is known as
East Tennessee. This plateau is about 2,200
feet above tidewater.</p>

<p>Chattanooga is the commercial gateway
through which run both the Tennessee River and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the railways from north, east, and south. It lies
near the junction of the boundary line between
Alabama and Georgia, with the south line of
Tennessee, at the eastern edge of the Cumberland
Mountains, where the Tennessee River, flowing
westward, cuts through the range. It is in a direct
southeast line from Nashville. The occupation
of Chattanooga by the Union Army cut the Confederacy
asunder. Hence, the struggle for this
position became a fierce one. It cost both sides
strenuous campaigns, an immense number of lives,
and the destruction of an incalculable amount of
property. Its possession by a Union Army was
an inhibition of any serious Confederate invasion
into Middle Tennessee or Kentucky. The object
of the Chattanooga campaign was, therefore,
the capture of that city; and ultimately, the destruction
of the Confederate Army. Should the
capture of the city be accomplished, but the army
of the Confederate escape, Chattanooga could be
made the sub-base of a new campaign, which
would effectually dismember the Confederacy,
and greatly hasten its downfall. Such was the
Union theory, and this actually occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Followed by the “March to the Sea,” the Atlanta
campaign dismembered the enemy’s domain
and made possible the end of the war. Lee’s surrender
would not have occurred at the time it did
(April, 1865), if the homes of his soldiers in the
Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama
had not been invaded by the Western armies of
the Union; and his rear threatened by Sherman’s
troops. These results were made possible only
by the capture and continued possession of Chattanooga.</p>

<p>After Sherman had marched through Georgia
and South Carolina, and penetrated North Carolina,
with a large part of the old Army of the
Cumberland and troops from other armies, thousands
of Lee’s army deserted, and lined the roads
leading back to their homes. When captured
and paroled, as they were in immense numbers, by
Sherman’s “bummers,” they invariably said that
they left Lee when Richmond was abandoned;
and would not longer fight for a Confederacy that
could not defend their homes. Love of home is
greater than love of country; unless the state or
nation can protect the homes from invasion and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
desecration, there is little incentive for its volunteers
to fight for the abstract principles of patriotism.</p>

<p>A description of the contour of the field, from
Murfreesboro to the Chickamauga, would be only
an interminable and profitless account; it being a
tangle of flat and rolling land, from Murfreesboro
to the gaps in the first hills, where the enemy
was met; and thenceforth steep mountains and
deep valleys. But the grand strategy subsequently
adopted by Rosecrans, depended so entirely
upon this contour, that when each separate
movement or battle shall hereafter be described,
a somewhat minute account of the country contiguous
to that particular military event will be
given.</p>

<h3>ORGANIZATION</h3>

<p>After the battle of Stone’s River and while
lying at Murfreesboro, the Army of the Cumberland
was reorganized. As previously stated,
Rosecrans joined it as the successor of Buell, at
Bowling Green, in October, 1862. Stone’s
River was the army’s first battle under Rosecrans.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
In that, the army was called the Fourteenth Corps,
Department of the Cumberland; and it was divided
into three divisions—the centre, right, and
left wings. General George H. Thomas commanded
the centre, General Alexander McD.
McCook the right, and General Thomas L. Crittenden
the left. In the new organization, the
command was called the Army of the Cumberland,
and divided into three corps, the Fourteenth,
the Twentieth, and the Twenty-first.
Thomas was assigned to the command of the
Fourteenth, General McCook to the Twentieth,
and Crittenden to the Twenty-first.</p>

<p>Rosecrans came to the Army of the Cumberland
with considerable prestige. He was then
forty-three years old, having graduated from West
Point in 1842. As brigadier-general he had
gained the battle of Rich Mountain, Virginia, in
July, 1861; won the battle of Carnifex Ferry,
Virginia, in September of the same year; as commander
of the Army of the Mississippi was victorious
in the battles of Iuka in September, 1862, and
of Corinth in October following. He came to the
Army of the Cumberland with a record of unbroken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
successes behind him. He was genial,
and had untiring industry. His heart and head
were devoted to the Union cause. His troops
saw him frequently. He was a lover of approbation,
and had the confidence of his generals,
and the love of his rank and file. The men affectionately
nicknamed him “Old Rosy,” and that
was his usual cognomen with the whole army.
He was a strategist of high order. A study of his
Chattanooga campaign will show his eminent ability,
in so maneuvering as to compel the enemy to
fight in the open. When an engagement was thus
brought on, and the actual combat occurred, he
lacked (in those which he fought with the Army
of the Cumberland) the proper supervision of his
line of battle. He too implicitly relied upon his
subordinates. During the whole of the Chattanooga
campaign his strategy was of the first order;
but at both Stone’s River and Chickamauga,
the right of his line was too attenuated; in both
engagements, disaster occurred to this part of his
troops.</p>

<p>The chief of staff to Rosecrans was General
James A. Garfield, who was then thirty-one years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
old, brainy and very energetic. Although not a
graduate of West Point, he was possessed of decided
military instincts. Before the war he was
an instructor in, and later president of, Hiram College,
Ohio; and later was a member of the Ohio
Senate. Entering the army as lieutenant-colonel
of an Ohio regiment, he defeated Humphrey Marshall
in the battle of Middle Creek, Eastern Kentucky,
January 10, 1862, and was that year promoted
to be a brigadier-general. Able and conscientious
as an officer, he was perhaps rather too
democratic and academic to become a typical soldier.
He became very nervous at the delay in
moving from Murfreesboro, and instituted an inquiry
into the reasons, both for and against an earlier
advance on Tullahoma. A majority of the
subordinate generals in the Army of the Cumberland
supported General Rosecrans in his delay.
Later on, notice will be taken of Garfield’s service
in the battle of Chickamauga, and his retirement
to a seat in Congress.</p>

<p>Next to Rosecrans, the most important figure
among the subordinate commanders was Thomas.
He was then forty-seven years old, and a graduate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
of West Point in 1840. Between that time and
the Civil War, he served in the war with Mexico,
and against the Indians in the West. At the beginning
of the War between the States he was
major of the Second Cavalry, of which Albert
Sidney Johnston was colonel, Robert E. Lee lieutenant-colonel,
and William J. Hardee senior
major. Thomas was the only field officer of that
regiment who remained loyal to the Union. He
was commissioned colonel of the regiment, reorganized
it, and during the first battle of Bull
Run served in General Patterson’s detachment,
in the Shenandoah Valley. He was commissioned
brigadier-general in August, 1861, and was
sent to Kentucky to serve in the then Army of the
Ohio (afterwards the Army of the Cumberland),
under General Robert Anderson of Fort Sumter
fame. Thomas organized the first real little
army of that department at camp Dick Robinson,
Kentucky, between Danville and Lexington; and
in January, 1862, with this force defeated the
Confederate troops under Zollicoffer, at Mill
Springs, Kentucky, on the Cumberland River.
This force and this place were then the extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
right of the Confederate line of defense, of which
Forts Donelson and Henry, in Tennessee, and
Paducah, Kentucky, constituted the left. This
line was fortified, and extended through Bowling
Green. A month after General Thomas had
turned its right at Mill Springs, General Grant
also turned its left, by capturing both Forts Donelson
and Henry. This necessitated the establishment
of a new Confederate line farther south,
the evacuation of Kentucky, and the eventual loss
to the Confederates of Middle Tennessee. Just
before the battle of Perryville, Kentucky, the
President offered General Thomas, on September
29, 1862, the command of the Army of the Cumberland
at Louisville, but he declined it. Buell
was in command of the army during the battle of
Perryville; after which he was superseded by
Rosecrans. Thomas was a soldier, pure and
simple, having never resigned from the army after
his graduation from the Military Academy. He
had shown great ability in the recent battle of
Stone’s River, as well as in every position in
which he was placed, prior to that battle. It
will be seen, further on, what important movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
he directed in the battle of Chickamauga,
which saved the Army of the Cumberland from
imminent disaster.</p>

<p>General McCook, who commanded the Twentieth
Corps, belonged to the younger class of West
Point graduates, of which General Sheridan was
a type. He graduated in 1853, and was thirty-two
years old in April, 1863. He was a handsome
man, of striking presence, and commanded
with some dramatic effect.</p>

<p>General Crittenden, commanding the Twenty-first
Corps, was then a year older than Rosecrans—forty-four
years. He was not a graduate of
West Point, but had served as a volunteer in the
Mexican War. He was a son of U. S. Senator
John J. Crittenden, of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth Corps was made up of four
divisions. These were commanded respectively
by Major-General Lovell H. Rousseau, Major-General
James S. Negley, Brigadier-General
John M. Brannan, and Major-General Joseph J.
Reynolds. Each of these divisions contained
three brigades, and three light field batteries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
The brigades were generally composed of four
regiments, but sometimes of five.</p>

<p>The Twentieth Corps contained three divisions,
commanded respectively by Brigadier-General
Jefferson C. Davis, Brigadier-General Richard
W. Johnson, and Major-General Philip H.
Sheridan. These were made up of brigades of
four and five regiments of infantry and three batteries
of artillery.</p>

<p>The Twenty-first Corps likewise was organized
into three divisions, commanded by Brigadier-General
Thomas J. Wood, Major-General
John M. Palmer, and Brigadier-General Horatio
P. Van Cleve, each with three brigades and
several batteries. The artillery of each division
of the army was commanded by a chief of artillery.</p>

<p>All of the cavalry were organized into a separate
corps, commanded by Major-General David
S. Stanley. This was divided into two divisions;
the First was composed of two brigades, and commanded
by Brigadier-General Robert B. Mitchell;
the Second, also of two brigades, was commanded
at first by Brigadier-General John B. Turchin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Prior to the battle of Chickamauga, Turchin
was assigned to an infantry brigade. These
cavalry brigades were much larger than the infantry
brigades, for they contained five or six regiments.
Generally there was a battery attached
to each brigade of cavalry.</p>

<p>On June 8, 1863, a reserve corps was organized,
with Major-General Gordon Granger in command.
It contained three divisions, commanded
by Brigadier-General James D. Morgan, Brigadier-General
Robert S. Granger, and Brigadier-General
Absalom Baird, respectively. The last-named
was afterwards transferred to the First Division,
Fourteenth Corps, being succeeded by
General James B. Steedman. It was the duty of
this reserve corps to guard the communications in
the rear of the army; but it was also subject, in
emergency, to be ordered to the front, as will be
seen further on—for example, when General
Granger with three brigades, marched from
Bridgeport, Alabama, to Rossville Gap, Georgia,
and assisted very greatly in the battle of September
20, at Chickamauga. In this reserve corps
should also be included certain miscellaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
troops, scattered in forts along the line of the Louisville
&amp; Chattanooga railroad, such as Nashville,
Clarksville, and Gallatin, Tennessee. At this
time Colonel Benjamin J. Sweet of the Twenty-first
Wisconsin Infantry was in command of the
forces at Gallatin. He had been wounded severely
in the battle of Perryville, Kentucky, on
October 8, 1862, and was not able to endure active
service at the front.</p>

<p>The First Brigade of the Third Division, reserve
corps, was stationed at Fort Donelson, Tennessee,
and commanded by Colonel William P.
Lyon, of the Thirteenth Wisconsin Infantry, that
regiment being a part of the garrison. The First
Wisconsin Cavalry, commanded by Colonel Oscar
H. LaGrange, was attached to the Second
Brigade of the First Division of the cavalry corps.
Captain Lucius H. Drury, of the Third Wisconsin
Battery, was chief of artillery to the Third Division
of the Twenty-first Corps.</p>

<p>This organization of the Army of the Cumberland
remained substantially the same, until after
the battle of Chickamauga. Sometime in the
latter part of July, or first part of August, General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Rousseau received leave of absence, and General
Absalom Baird was assigned on August 24 to
command the First Division of the Fourteenth
Corps in his stead. Baird remained in command
of this division until after the battle of Chickamauga,
when Major-General Lovell H. Rousseau
again took the command. Rousseau was
a loyal Kentuckian, who at the very beginning
of hostilities had raised a regiment for the service
of the Union. He was then forty-five years old
and had served in the Mexican War. He
was a spectacular officer of great bravery, who is
entitled to much credit for his unflinching devotion
to the Union, under circumstances which
made other men desert our cause.</p>

<p>Major-General John M. Palmer of Illinois, a
lawyer of eminence in his State, was an officer of
more than usual ability. He was not a West
Point graduate, and was forty-six years old.</p>

<p>General Granger was then forty-two years old,
a graduate of West Point in the class of 1845,
and had fought in the Mexican War. It will be
noticed that many of the general officers of the
Army of the Cumberland served in the Mexican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
War. The experience they then acquired in the
field, in actual campaigning, and by some of
them in actual battle, undoubtedly served to give
to the Army of the Cumberland much of its <i>esprit
de corps</i>, and its general success in winning battles
and in holding the territory over which it marched.
General Granger was an unusually able and gallant
officer. Later on, it will be told what important
service he rendered General Thomas in
the battle of Chickamauga.</p>

<p>Major-General Philip H. Sheridan was then
thirty-two years old. He graduated at West
Point, rather low in his class, in 1853. At the
outbreak of the war he was promoted to a
captaincy. In May, 1862, he was commissioned
colonel of cavalry in the volunteer service, and
brigadier-general of volunteers July 1, 1862, being
made a major-general on December 31, 1862.
He had commanded a division in the battle of
Perryville, Kentucky, in October, 1862, and was
at Stone’s River December 31, 1862, to January
3, 1863. He is entitled to this special notice
more for what he became, than for what he had
done prior to the Chattanooga campaign. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
had as yet shown no extraordinary ability as a
commander. His age was the same as that of his
corps commander, General McCook, and they
graduated in the same class at West Point.</p>

<p>Generals Absalom Baird, John M. Brannan,
Jefferson C. Davis, Thomas J. Wood, R. W.
Johnson, and David S. Stanley were all officers
of the old regular army, soldiers by profession,
whose minds were not distracted from their duties
in the field by politics or academic proclivities.
They were brave and always at the front, working
for success with military spirit. All of them
served faithfully until the close of the war. Davis,
Wood, and Stanley afterwards commanded corps—commanded
them ably and with notably unassuming
manners. There was no taint about these
officers of “playing to the galleries.” They were
not expecting applause, and did their work without
brass bands or reporters to sound their achievements
to the country. Such were the officers of
this great central army.</p>

<p>What of the musket bearers? Who were
they? Where did they come from? Were
they soldiers by profession or merely citizens in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
arms for a special purpose? I have already said
that very many of the general officers of the Army
of the Cumberland were of the regular army.
The United States regular army was represented
only, however, by one brigade of the regular
troops, namely, the Third Brigade of the First Division
of the Fourteenth Corps, commanded by
Brigadier-General John H. King. Thus almost
the entire rank and file of the army were volunteers.
The regiments were filled and officered
by the executives of the different states. The men
were mustered into the service of the General
Government as volunteers for three years or during
the war. These volunteers were citizens of the
states, and each company elected its officers among
those who had originally enlisted as privates.
The musket bearers were men from all callings
in life—farmers, mechanics, merchants, teachers,
students, and laborers. They were the voters
who made up the political divisions of the townships,
counties, and states, whose ultimate power
lay in their voting franchise which they shared
with the men, who—for various reasons—remained
at their homes during the war. The volunteer-regiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
which composed the Army of
the Cumberland were mostly from the states of
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Kentucky,
Wisconsin, and Minnesota; Pennsylvania had
three infantry and two cavalry regiments; Missouri
had two regiments, and Kansas one; Tennessee
was represented by several regiments. The
great bulk of the troops came, however, from the
states north of the Ohio River—the Northwest
Territory. No drafted men in the army partook
in the Chattanooga Campaign of 1863. These
volunteers sought the service and understood what
it involved. Very few of them knew what regimentation
meant, and the great majority had never
before handled a musket. But they were young
and teachable. They readily learned the drill,
and became good marksmen. These soldiers realized
very soon that a clean musket, plenty of ammunition,
and obedience to orders, composed the
military moral code of efficiency. By the laws
of their states, they were entitled to vote for officers
and affairs at home, and to have their votes counted,
just as if they had been cast at home. The soldiers
received during the prolonged war as many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
furloughs as were compatible with the exigencies
at the front, and thus they were occasionally enabled
to visit the folks at home during their strenuous
service. The intelligence of the private soldier
was often superior to that of his officer. Nevertheless
he obeyed faithfully that officer’s commands,
because he fully understood that discipline
could be maintained only by implicit obedience
and the object of his service, viz: the suppression
of a rebellion be accomplished. Many of these
volunteers enlisted directly from the public schools,
which they were attending. They had been
taught the history of their country; how its independence
from the tyranny of a foreign power had
been gained by the valor and patriotism of Washington
and his volunteers, that by the discipline and
perseverance of the revolutionary soldiers the sovereignty
of a foreign king had been transferred to
the citizens of their native land; that a new foe was
now trying to dismember the nation, and that the
corner stone of the Union was the principle, that
all power is derived from the people. These volunteers
were convinced that no power had the
right to protect the maintenance and perpetuation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
of slavery. They were soldiers therefore until the
Union was re-established; and they tacitly resolved
to fight until slavery was abolished. Such
was the personnel of the Army of the Cumberland.</p>

<p>Wisconsin was well and ably represented in this
army by the following organizations, viz: The
First, Tenth, Fifteenth, Twenty-first, and Twenty-fourth
volunteer infantry; the First Cavalry;
and the Third, Fifth, and Eighth light batteries.</p>

<p>The First Wisconsin Infantry was a noted regiment
in more than one way. It served as the only
three-months regiment from Wisconsin, and was
organized under President Lincoln’s first call for
75,000 men. It was mustered out after the
ninety days’ service August 21, 1861, and reorganized
under the second call for three years’ service.
This second mustering was completed October
19, 1861. The regiment proceeded from
Milwaukee to Louisville, Kentucky, and the volunteers
served during the next three years in the
Army of the Cumberland. It was active in various
parts of Tennessee during the first year of its service,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
marching as far as Bridgeport, Alabama, to
which place it returned during the campaign of
Tullahoma. John C. Starkweather was its first
colonel. He was made commander of the brigade
when it was reorganized at Murfreesboro, and
Lieutenant-Colonel George B. Bingham commanded
the regiment. This regiment had fought
in both the battles of Perryville and Stone’s River.
It was assigned to the Second Brigade of the First
Division of the Fourteenth Corps.</p>

<p>The Tenth Wisconsin Infantry was mustered
into the service October 14, 1861, at Milwaukee.
Alfred R. Chapin was its first colonel. Proceeding
to Louisville, Kentucky, it became part of the
future Army of the Cumberland, and advanced
with General O. M. Mitchell’s forces to Stevenson
and Huntsville, Alabama, in the spring and
summer of 1862. The regiment returned to
Louisville in September with Buell’s army and
engaged in the battles of Perryville and Stone’s
River. When the reorganization at Murfreesboro
took place this regiment became a part of
Scribner’s Brigade of Rousseau’s Division of the
Fourteenth Corps. Almost side by side with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
First and Twenty-first infantries, it took part in all
engagements.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth Wisconsin Infantry was a Scandinavian
regiment, and its first colonel was Hans
C. Heg. It was mustered into the service on February
14, 1862, at Madison. It had taken part in
the siege of Island Number Ten. It did not join
the Army of the Cumberland until just before the
battle of Perryville, in which it took active part, as
in the battle of Stone’s River. In the reorganization
at Murfreesboro, it became a part of the Third
Brigade—and was commanded by its colonel,
Hans C. Heg, of the First Division, Twentieth
Corps.</p>

<p>The Twenty-first Wisconsin Infantry was organized
at Oshkosh, in August, 1862, and on September
11, 1862, it joined the Army of the Cumberland
at Louisville, Kentucky. Benjamin J.
Sweet was its first colonel; he was so severely
wounded in the battle of Perryville as to be disabled
for further field service. This regiment was
brigaded with the First Wisconsin Infantry at
Louisville, and served also in the battles of
Perryville and Stone’s River. At the time of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the reorganization at Murfreesboro it was commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Harrison C. Hobart,
and it was assigned to the Second Brigade of
the First Division of the Fourteenth Corps.</p>

<p>The Twenty-fourth Wisconsin Infantry was
mustered into the service at Milwaukee, August
21, 1862. It proceeded to Louisville, where it
became a part of the Army of the Cumberland.
This regiment engaged in the battles of Perryville
and Stone’s River, and was assigned to the First
Brigade, Third Division, Twentieth Corps in the
reorganization at Murfreesboro; its commander
was Lieutenant-Colonel Theodore S. West.</p>

<p>The First Wisconsin Cavalry was mustered into
the service at Kenosha, on March 8, 1862, with
Edward Daniels as its first colonel. It was sent
to Benton Barracks, near St. Louis. There and
in various parts of Missouri its first year of service
was performed. On June 14, 1863, at Nashville,
it was made a part of the Army of the Cumberland,
with which it was from that time identified
until the close of its service. This regiment’s
activity in the Tullahoma campaign, the Chickamauga
campaign, and in pursuit of Confederate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
cavalry in the Sequatchie Valley on October 2,
1863, and along the line of communication during
the battles around Chattanooga is mentioned in
more appropriate places, relating to the general
movements of the army. It was commanded by
Colonel Oscar H. LaGrange, and assigned to the
Second Brigade, First Division, Cavalry Corps,
during the reorganization.</p>

<p>The Third Wisconsin Light Battery was mustered
into the service at Racine, Wisconsin, October
10, 1861. Lucius H. Drury was its first captain.
The regiment went first to Louisville, then
to Nashville, whence it marched with Buell’s
army in order to reinforce General Grant at Shiloh.
It was engaged in the battles of Perryville and
Stone’s River. The regiment was assigned to the
Third Brigade, Third Division of the Twenty-first
Corps, and was commanded by Lieutenant
Courtland Livingston.</p>

<p>The Fifth Wisconsin Battery was mustered into
the service at Racine, October 1, 1861. Oscar
F. Pinney was its first captain. March 16,
1862, it arrived at St. Louis. Afterwards it proceeded
to New Madrid, Missouri (on the Mississippi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
River), and became a part of General John
Pope’s army, in the reduction of Island Number
Ten. It was also active at the siege of Corinth,
and marched about two hundred miles from Iuka,
Mississippi, to Nashville, Tennessee, where the
regiment joined the forces of General Buell. On
the northward march in September, 1862, these
forces engaged in the battles of Perryville and
Stone’s River; the service of the Fifth Wisconsin
Battery was of the most active and valuable kind.
It was commanded by Captain George Q. Gardner,
and was assigned to the First Brigade, First
Division, of the Twentieth Corps.</p>

<p>The Eighth Wisconsin Battery was mustered
into the service on January 8, 1862, and moved to
St. Louis on March 8, 1862. Its first captain
was Stephen J. Carpenter. It formed a part of
the force that moved to Forts Leavenworth and
Riley, Kansas, in April and May, 1862, whence
it moved to Columbus, Kentucky, and finally
took part in the campaign at Corinth and Iuka,
Mississippi. From there it marched to Nashville,
and Louisville, engaging in the battles of
Perryville and Stone’s River. It was commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
by John D. McLean, lieutenant, and
was assigned to the Third Brigade, First Division
of the Twentieth Corps.</p>

<h3>ORGANIZATION OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMY</h3>

<p>The Confederate Army which confronted the
Army of the Cumberland on June 24, 1863, was
officially called the Army of the Tennessee. It
was divided into four corps—two of infantry and
two of cavalry. General Leonidas Polk commanded
one infantry corps, and General William
J. Hardee the other. The cavalry corps
were commanded by General Joseph Wheeler,
and General N. B. Forrest. In addition to the
artillery, attached to the regular corps, there was
also a reserve artillery. In General Bragg’s return
of the “aggregate present” of his army in the field
on June 20, 1863, his figures are 55,070. His reserve
troops were not included in this statement;
they were scattered throughout the districts of Tennessee
and northern Alabama.</p>

<p>At this same date the return of the Army of the
Cumberland was 71,409 of all arms—exclusive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of the reserve corps—as “aggregate present.” It
will be noticed later on, that the Confederates
greatly increased their numbers prior to the battle
of Chickamauga, but that the Union Army received
no reinforcements; on the contrary, it lost
heavily by sickness as the army advanced.</p>

<p>General Bragg was at that time forty-six years
old. He had distinguished himself in the Mexican
War. He commanded the Confederate
Army in both the battles of Perryville and Stone’s
River. He did not win either of these, having
in both of them abandoned the field to the Union
forces.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most distinguished officer in
Bragg’s army was Major-General John C. Breckenridge.
He was more distinguished, however,
as a politician, than as a military leader. He
was forty-two years old. Before the war he had
been a member of Congress, vice-president of the
United States, and in 1860 the presidential candidate
of the Southern democrats. At the breaking
out of the war, he was a United States Senator
from Kentucky. He was a Confederate officer
at Shiloh in April, 1862, and commanded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
right wing of the Southern forces at Stone’s River.</p>

<p>General Leonidas Polk was fifty-seven years
old in 1863. He was a bishop of the Episcopal
church. He graduated from West Point in
1827, but resigned his commission in the army in
the same year. He entered the Confederate
Army as a major-general, but was soon promoted
to lieutenant-general.</p>

<p>General William J. Hardee was forty-seven
years old at this time. He graduated from West
Point in the class of 1838. He served with distinction
in the Mexican War. He entered the
Confederate service as colonel, commanded a corps
at Shiloh in 1862; was appointed lieutenant-general
in October, 1862; and commanded the left
wing of the Southern Army at Perryville.</p>

<p>General Simon Bolivar Buckner, another officer
in the Confederate Army, was forty years old,
and a West Pointer. He surrendered Fort Donelson
to General Grant in February, 1862.</p>

<p>Of the two Confederate cavalry commanders,
General Nathan B. Forrest was by far the
greater. He was a rough, uneducated man, but
of great force as a partisan leader. When Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Wolseley was at the head of the British Army, he
said of Forrest that he was the ablest cavalry
leader that was produced by our War between the
States. He was personally brave, possessed a
fine physique, and had sufficient magnetism to inspire
the soldiers of his command to great activity
and endurance. During the war twenty-nine
horses were shot under him, and he took active part
in thirty-one encounters, it has been stated. He
was wounded several times.</p>

<p>The rank and file of the Confederates were
made up of the citizens of the Southern states, in
much the same manner that the Union Army was
composed of Northern citizens. They fought
with a certain fanaticism, for what they deemed
their rights. It is singular, that at the beginning
of the war, so universal a desire to dissolve the
Union seized the great majority of the white people
of the South, although they might not be slave
owners. They made most efficient soldiers and
suffered many hardships, unknown to the soldiers
of the Union Army. The martial temperament, inherited
as well as acquired through personal habits,
was more predominant in the South than in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the North. The Southerners lived largely a
country-life before the war; they rode horseback,
hunted with hounds, and had become more familiar
with firearms than the Northerners. The
practice of duelling continued longer with them
than with the men of the North, who were not
as fiery tempered as those of the South. These
traits made them soldiers by nature; they liked
to serve in the field, and were therefore difficult
to conquer. They seemed more lithe and active,
than the staid volunteers from the colder North.
They have claimed, that they were largely outnumbered;
that is true in the aggregate, but not
so true on the firing line. The battles of Stone’s
River and Chickamauga illustrate these facts.
The numbers in both armies were quite evenly
matched. During the last year of this war
there was little difference in the fighting qualities
of the veteran regiments on both sides. The rebellion
was put down according to the rules of
warfare, and whatever that result may have cost
in numbers, it was worth the price. Not every
revolt against authoritative power has been suppressed
by superior numbers, not even that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
thirteen colonies against England’s. At first, the
power of England seemed so overwhelming, that
scarcely any one expected that colonial independence
could be gained. Foreign nations did not
believe that this rebellion could be suppressed,
notwithstanding the superiority in numbers of the
Union Army.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing about it is, that Lincoln
persevered to the end, against discouragements
and disasters which seemed, at the time, to be insurmountable.
Fortunately there was no compromise,
the rebellion was simply crushed, no terms
were made; and no promises given to embarrass the
reconstruction. Of course, it required large armies
and grim determination to reach the goal. The
great fact is, not that the Union armies outnumbered
the Confederate forces, but that the Union itself
was restored. The war was merciless; all wars
are. Mercy, pity, and the extension of the hand
of helpfulness came after the war was over, not
while it was going on. Each side did all it could
to fight and win its battles. The North had the
larger number of citizens from which to draw, and
of course, availed itself of that advantage. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
South would have put larger armies into the field if
it could have done so; it did use every available
man, however, and fought its best. The South
might have conquered the Union by overwhelming
forces, could such have been secured, but available
men were lacking. At all events, the rebellion
was crushed by means of legitimate warfare,
and the Union was restored.</p>

<h3>THE ADVANCE OF THE UNION ARMY</h3>

<p>The Confederate Army, commanded by General
Braxton Bragg, lay in front of Tullahoma,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
where Bragg had his headquarters. There was a
large entrenched camp at the junction of the Nashville
&amp; Chattanooga railroad. This camp and
the McMinnville branch was each a secondary
depot for commissary stores, while the base of supplies
was at Chattanooga. Its front was covered
by the defiles of the Duck River, a deep narrow
stream edged by a rough range of hills, which
divides the “Barrens” from the lower level of
Middle Tennessee. The Manchester Pike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
passes through these hills at Hoover’s Gap, nineteen
miles south of Murfreesboro, ascending
through a long and difficult canon to the “Barrens”.
The Wartrace road runs through Liberty
Gap, thirteen miles south of Murfreesboro and
five miles west of Hoover’s. There were other
passes through these hills, but the enemy held all
of them. Bragg’s main position was in front of
Shelbyville, about twenty-eight miles southwest of
Murfreesboro, and was strengthened by a redan
line extending from Horse Mountain, located a
little to the north of Shelbyville, to Duck River on
the west, covered by a line of abatis. The road
from Murfreesboro to Shelbyville was through
Guy’s Gap, sixteen miles south of Murfreesboro.
Polk’s corps was at Shelbyville, Hardee’s held
Hoover’s, Liberty, and Bellbuckle gaps, all in
the same range of hills. It was not wise to move
directly against the entrenched line at Shelbyville,
therefore Rosecrans’s plan was to turn the Confederate
right and move on to the railroad bridge,
across Elk River, nine miles southeast of Tullahoma.
To accomplish this, it was necessary to
make Bragg believe that the advance would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
by the Shelbyville route. The following dispositions
were therefore made: General Granger’s
command was at Triune on June 23, fifteen miles
west of Murfreesboro; some infantry and cavalry
advanced that same day toward Woodbury
seventeen miles to the east of Murfreesboro;
simultaneously Granger sent General Mitchell’s
cavalry division on the Eaglesville and Shelbyville
Pike, seventeen miles southwest of Murfreesboro,
in order to make an attack on the enemy’s
cavalry, and to drive the enemy’s infantry guards
on their main line. General Granger, with his
own infantry troops and Brannan’s division,
moved—with ten days rations—to Salem.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>On June 24, Granger moved to Christiana, a
small village a few miles southwest of Murfreesboro,
south of Salem, towards Shelbyville. On
the same day Palmer’s division, and a brigade of
cavalry, were ordered to move to the vicinity of
Bradyville, fourteen miles southeast of Murfreesboro;
his advance columns were to seize the head of
the defile leading up to the “Barrens” by an obscure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
road to Manchester thirty-five miles southeast,
and by way of Lumley’s Stand seven miles
east of Hoover’s Gap. General Mitchell accomplished
his work after a sharp and gallant
fight. McCook’s corps advanced on the Shelbyville
road, and turning to the left, six miles out,
moved two divisions via Millersburg, a small village
eleven miles south of Murfreesboro. By
advancing on the road to Wartrace<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> he seized and
held Liberty Gap.</p>

<p>Five companies of the Thirty-ninth Indiana
mounted infantry opened the fight for Liberty
Gap on June 24; they were followed by Willich’s
brigade. General R. W. Johnson, in his
report<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> says: “Here I placed at the disposal of
General Willich a portion of the Second Brigade,
Colonel Miller commanding, who sent the
Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania and the Twenty-ninth
Indiana to the right of the Fifteenth Ohio,
then to change direction to the left, sweeping the
hillside on which the Confederates were posted.
This movement was handsomely executed. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
soon as the change to the left had been made,
General Willich ordered his entire line forward.
Under his own eye and management, the Confederates
were driven at every point, their camps
and camp equipages falling into our hands, and
Liberty Gap was in our possession.” The next
morning Carlin’s and Post’s brigades of Davis’s
division came to Johnson’s support. The Confederates
attacked quite fiercely, but were repulsed,
and finally retired. The enemy here was
Cleburne’s division; he reported a loss of 121.</p>

<p>General Thomas advanced on the Manchester
Pike with the Fourteenth Corps in order to make
an attempt to take possession of Hoover’s Gap.
Major-General Crittenden was to leave Van
Cleve’s division of the Twenty-first Corps at
Murfreesboro, concentrate at Bradyville, fourteen
miles southeast of Murfreesboro, and there await
orders. All these movements were executed
with success in the midst of a continuous rain,
which so softened the surface of the roads, as to
render them next to impassable. The advance of
the Fourteenth Corps on Hoover’s Gap, June 24,
was Wilder’s brigade of mounted infantry, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Reynolds’s division; it was followed by the other
two brigades of the same division. Wilder struck
the enemy’s pickets within two miles of his camp
at Murfreesboro and drove them through Hoover’s
Gap to McBride’s Creek. The two rear
brigades moved up and occupied the Gap. Soon
afterwards Wilder’s brigade was attacked by a
portion of Stewart’s division; this brought the rest
of Reynolds’s division, and eventually the regular
brigade of Rousseau’s division to his assistance.</p>

<p>On June 25 and 26, Rousseau’s, Reynolds’s,
and Brannan’s divisions cooperated in an advance
on the enemy; after a short resistance the enemy
fled to Fairfield, five miles southwest of Hoover’s
Gap, towards which place the Union pickets had
advanced.</p>

<p>The First and the Twenty-first Wisconsin infantry
were actively engaged at Hoover’s Gap,
but suffered no casualties. The Seventy-ninth
Pennsylvania, in the same brigade, lost twelve
men, one wounded. General John T. Wilder’s
brigade lost sixty-one men killed and wounded.</p>

<p>On June 27, Gordon Granger captured Guy’s
Gap and the same evening took Shelbyville,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the main Confederate Army having retreated.
The Union headquarters reached Manchester
on June 27. Here the Fourteenth Corps concentrated
during the night. Part of McCook’s arrived
on the 25th; the rest of it did not reach Manchester
before the night of the 29th. The troops
and animals were very jaded. Crittenden’s
Twenty-first Corps was considerably delayed.
The troops encountered continuous rains and bad
roads, and the last division did not arrive at Manchester
before June 29, although an order to march
there speedily was received on the 26th. On arrival
it was badly worn out.</p>

<p>The forces were at last concentrated on the
enemy’s right flank, about ten miles northeast
of Tullahoma. During the incessant rain of
June 30, an effort was made to form them into
position in anticipation of an attack by the
enemy. The wagons and horses could scarcely
traverse the ground, which was quite swampy.
Fortunately the enemy’s forces suffered likewise.
What was trial and hardship to one of
the armies—on account of the weather—was
equally detrimental to the other side. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
army which could overcome quickly and victoriously
the climatic conditions, had the best chances
to win in the martial contest. In forming a line
at Manchester to resist an attack, the Fourteenth
Corps occupied the centre, with one division in
reserve, the Twentieth Corps on the right and
the Twenty-first on the left. The last two corps
had each one division in reserve. The Union
Army was on the right flank of the Confederate
line of defense, and of course expected to be attacked.
But it was not.</p>

<p>In the meantime Stanley’s cavalry, supported
by General Gordon Granger’s infantry and all
troops under Granger’s direction, had attacked
the enemy at Guy’s Gap—sixteen miles south of
Murfreesboro and five miles west of Liberty
Gap—and had driven the Confederate troops
back to their entrenchments. Then, finding that
the enemy’s main army had fallen back, Stanley
captured the gap by a direct and flank movement
with only three pieces of artillery. The cavalry
unexpectedly captured Shelbyville with a number
of prisoners, a quantity of arms, and the
commissary stores. The reports of this cavalry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
battle show the retreat of the enemy to Tullahoma
forty miles southeast of Murfreesboro, where it
was supposed that he intended to make a stand.
But on July 1, General Thomas ascertained that
the enemy had retreated during the night from
Tullahoma. Some Union divisions occupied
Tullahoma about noon that same day, while
Rousseau’s and Negley’s divisions pushed on by
way of Spring Creek overtaking late in the afternoon
the rear guard, with which these divisions
had a sharp skirmish.</p>

<p>On July 2, the pursuit was made by the Fourteenth
and Twentieth corps. The bridge over
the Elk River had been burned by the enemy
while retreating. The stream had risen and the
cavalry could barely ford the river. On
July 3, Sheridan’s and Davis’s divisions of the
Twentieth Corps, having succeeded in crossing
the Elk River, pursued the enemy to Cowan, on
the Cumberland plateau, eighteen miles southeast
of Tullahoma. Here it was learned that the
enemy had crossed the mountains; and that only
cavalry troops covered its retreat. Meanwhile
the Union Army halted to await needed supplies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
which had to be hauled by wagon from Murfreesboro
over miserable roads. These supplies had
to be stored at the railway station, nearest to the
probable battlefield; and before the army could
advance over the Cumberland plateau—where a
battle would probably soon ensue—the railway
had to be repaired. General Rosecrans in his
official report says: “Thus ended a nine days’
campaign, which drove the enemy from two fortified
positions and gave us possession of Middle
Tennessee, conducted in one of the most extraordinary
rains ever known in Tennessee at that
period of the year, over a soil that became almost
a quicksand.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He claims—perhaps justly—that
it was this extraordinary rain and bad roads,
which prevented his getting possession of the
enemy’s communications, and debarred him
from forcing the Confederate Army to fight a disastrous
battle. He speaks very highly of James
A. Garfield, his chief of staff, saying: “He
possesses the instincts and energy of a great commander.”</p>

<p>The Union losses during the “Tullahoma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Campaign”—thus named in the official record—were
as follows: 14 officers killed, and
26 wounded; 71 non-commissioned officers and
privates killed, and 436 wounded; 13 missing.
Total, 85 killed, 462 wounded, and 13 missing.
1,634 prisoners were taken, some artillery and
small arms of very little value; 3,500 sacks of
corn and cornmeal were secured.</p>

<p>On July 3, General Braxton Bragg sent the following
dispatch from Bridgeport, Alabama—twenty-eight
miles directly west from Chattanooga—to
Richmond, Virginia: “Unable to obtain
a general engagement without sacrificing my
communications, I have, after a series of skirmishes,
withdrawn the army to this river. It is
now coming down the mountains. I hear of no
formidable pursuit.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The Confederate Army
crossed the mountains to the Tennessee River
and on July 7, 1863, encamped near Chattanooga.
The Union Army went into camp
along the northwestern base of the Cumberland
plateau. The object of the Army of the Cumberland
for the ensuing campaign was Chattanooga;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the Tullahoma campaign was only a small
part of the greater one which had yet to take place.</p>

<p>In the Tullahoma campaign the Tenth Wisconsin
Infantry lost 3 enlisted men, wounded,
and the First Wisconsin Cavalry 2 enlisted
men. All the Wisconsin troops bore their full
share of the fatigues of the campaign, but only the
losses mentioned were reported.</p>

<p>There was one feature of the Tullahoma campaign
that was very peculiar. A part of the
Union Army had the previous year passed over
this same region, while marching to the relief of
Grant at Shiloh. Now returning by the way of
Chattanooga, where Buell had marched on his
way back to Louisville, they again came to this
section of the country where the inhabitants mostly
sympathized with the South. They were surprised
and shocked in 1862 when the hated
Yankees invaded their towns and farms. The
Confederate authorities told them, that another invasion
would never occur, that they could plant
their crops and pursue their business without fear.
Therefore, when their country was again overrun
by the Union Army in 1863, their confidence in
the Confederate generals was quite shaken.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<i>The Chickamauga Campaign and Battle</i></h2>
</div>

<p>A distinguished Confederate general—speaking
of the importance of the city of Chattanooga
to the Confederacy—said: “As long as we held
it, it was the closed doorway to the interior of
our country. When it came into your [the
Union’s] hands the door stood open, and however
rough your progress in the interior might be, it still
left you free to march inside. I tell you that when
your Dutch general Rosecrans commenced his
forward movement for the capture of Chattanooga
we laughed him to scorn; we believed that
the black brow of Lookout Mountain would
frown him out of existence; that he would dash
himself to pieces against the many and vast natural
barriers that rise all around Chattanooga; and that
then the northern people and the government at
Washington would perceive how hopeless were
their efforts when they came to attack the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
South.” With regard to the claim that Chickamauga
was a failure for the Union arms, he said:
“We would gladly have exchanged a dozen of
our previous victories for that one failure.” It is
correctly said, that even Richmond was but an
outpost, until the success of the Union armies—in
the centre of the Confederacy—left Lee’s legions
nowhere to go, when they were expelled from
Richmond.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This was accomplished or made possible
only by the operations of the Army of the
Cumberland in the Chattanooga Campaign of
1863.</p>

<p>After the retreat of the Confederate Army of
the Tennessee from the region about Tullahoma,
across the Cumberland Plateau to Chattanooga,
Rosecrans established his headquarters at Winchester,
Tennessee.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He began the repair of the
railroad back to Murfreesboro and forward
to Stevenson, Alabama, ten miles southeast
of Bridgeport and eight miles north of the Tennessee
River. The three corps were put into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
camp in their normal order. The Twentieth
Corps occupied the country adjacent to Winchester;
the Fourteenth Corps the region near to
Decherd;<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the Twenty-first Corps occupied the
country near McMinnville.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Detachments were
thrown forward as far as Stevenson. The
campaign had so far been mere child’s play,
compared with what lay before the army in the
next movement against Chattanooga and the Confederate
Army. The straight line of the plateau
is thirty miles across from Winchester to the
Tennessee River; the distance is perhaps forty
miles by the available roads. The railroad after
reaching the summit of the plateau followed
down Big Crow Creek to Stevenson, then turned
sharply up the valley of the Tennessee, crossing
the river at Bridgeport to the South side; then
winding among numerous hills, which constitute
the south end of the Sand Mountain, continued
around the northern nose of Lookout Mountain,
close to the river bank, into Chattanooga.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Bridgeport is on the Tennessee River twenty-eight
miles in a straight line west of Chattanooga.
Just opposite, towards the northern nose of Sand
Mountain, on the north side of the river, is the
southern end of Walden’s Ridge which extends
northward from the river, and parallel with the
plateau, from which it is separated by the Sequatchie
River and Valley. In short the Cumberland
Mountains are here a series of ridges and valleys
which run from northeast to southwest in a
uniform trend, parallel with each other. The
Tennessee River rises in southwestern Virginia,
and runs between the Cumberland Plateau and
Sand Mountain; but between Chattanooga and
Bridgeport it cuts a zigzag channel towards the
west, between Sand Mountain and Walden’s
Ridge, which is the name given to that portion of
the ridge lying on the north of the river. What
the Army of the Cumberland intended to do was
to cross the ridge, called the Cumberland Plateau,
then the river, and the Sand Mountain into Lookout
Valley and then the Lookout Ridge, in order
to reach the Chattanooga Valley south of Chattanooga.
Such a movement would force Bragg to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
march out of the city to defend his communications.
These ridges are all linked together at
different places. Sand and Lookout at Valley
Head, Alabama; the Cumberland Plateau and
Walden’s at the head of Sequatchie Valley and
River. Pigeon Mountain is a spur of Lookout
Ridge. Chattanooga is located on the south side
of the river, between the northern nose of Lookout
and Missionary Ridge. The latter is a separate
and low ridge about three miles southeast of
Chattanooga. Without a map it will be difficult
for the reader to perceive the rugged and almost
impassable field of operations, which General
Rosecrans faced, while his army lay at the northwestern
base of the Cumberland Plateau, waiting
for suitable preparation for the intended campaign.</p>

<p>There was an alternative line of advance open
to Rosecrans, namely to cross the plateau into the
Sequatchie Valley, or to march around the head
of the valley at Pikeville, then over Walden’s
Ridge, and thus attack Chattanooga directly
from the north; or, to cross the river above
and to the east of Chattanooga, at the north end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
of Missionary Ridge, that is, at the mouth of
the Hiawassie River. This last route would have
exposed his line of retreat or communications, and
he therefore chose to operate at his right and enter
into the valley south of Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Early in August the railroad was repaired to
Stevenson and Bridgeport; also the branch to
Tracy City on the plateau.</p>

<p>Sheridan’s division of the Twentieth Corps was
pushed forward to Stevenson and Bridgeport.
The commissary and quartermaster-stores were accumulated
at Stevenson as rapidly as possible.
By the 8th of August these supplies were sufficient
in quantity to justify a distribution of them
to the different commands, preparatory to an advance
across the river and over the difficult ridges,
that lay at almost right angles to the line of movement.
The advance of the main army began
August 16.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth Corps crossed along the railroad
line, or near to it. Its advance was soon at
Stevenson and some of it at Bridgeport. The
Twenty-first Corps—which formed the left of the
army at McMinnville—crossed by the way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Pelham, a small village on the plateau, to Thurman’s
in the Sequatchie Valley. Minty’s cavalry
covered the left flank by way of Pikeville, a village
at the head of Sequatchie Valley. The Twentieth
Corps also came to Stevenson and its vicinity,
but by another route—to the right—than that taken
by the Fourteenth, namely, via Bellefont, ten miles
southwest of Stevenson, and Caperton’s Ferry,
which is the river point nearest to Stevenson.</p>

<p>All these crossings of the plateau were made
without resistance by the enemy, although there
were small Confederate cavalry outlooks here and
there, which fell back when the Union troops appeared.
It seemed as if Bragg desired to have the
Union Army advance as far as possible from its
base of supplies into the mountain gorges and over
a long and difficult line of communications. That
course would afford him a better chance, as his
army being reinforced would be in better condition
to successfully attack and destroy the Union
Army.</p>

<p>In order to save the hauling of full forage for
the animals, General Rosecrans had delayed his
movement until the corn should be sufficiently ripe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
No detail seemed wanting in the preparations for
the difficult campaign. Enough ammunition was
provided for at least two battles, and twenty-five
days rations for the troops were hauled in wagons.</p>

<p>The Tennessee River had to be crossed by the
different corps; in order to conceal this movement
and deceive the enemy at Chattanooga, Hagen’s
brigade of Palmer’s division, and Wagner’s of
Wood’s of the Twenty-first Corps, accompanied
by Wilder’s mounted infantry of Reynolds’s division,
crossed Walden’s Ridge from the Sequatchie
Valley into the valley of the Tennessee.
These troops made ostentatious demonstrations
upon Chattanooga from the north side of the river.
Wilder—with four guns of Lilly’s battery—appeared
suddenly before Chattanooga, threw some
shells into the city, sunk the steamer “Paint Rock,”
lying at the city landing, then ascending the river,
feigned to examine the crossings, making frequent
inquiry as to their difficulty and the character
of the country. On the other side of the river
east of Chattanooga, General Cleburne was sent
by Bragg to make preparations for defending the
crossings against the supposed advance of Rosecrans’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
army. He fortified the ferry crossings.
General Buckner—who commanded in East Tennessee
against the forces of Burnside—expressed
as his opinion on August 21, that General Rosecrans
would cross above the mouth of Hiawassie
River—a stream flowing northwards—and transfer
his forces into Tennessee on its south bank,
some thirty-five miles northeast of Chattanooga.
Buckner’s army was at the point mentioned.</p>

<p>Rosecrans’s intention was, however, to cross at
Caperton’s Ferry—near Bridgeport and not far
from Stevenson—and at Shellmound; these places
are from twenty to forty miles below and to the
west of Chattanooga. On August 20 at daybreak,
Heg’s brigade, of Davis’s division of the
Twentieth Corps, in which served the Fifteenth
Wisconsin Infantry, crossed in pontoon boats at
Caperton’s Ferry, drove away the enemy’s cavalry
and occupied the southern bank. Here a twelve
hundred feet pontoon bridge was soon completed,
and Davis’s division of the Twentieth Corps,
crossed and advanced to the foot of Sand Mountain,
preceded by cavalry. Johnson’s division
of the same corps crossed the following day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
on the same bridge. Sheridan’s division of the
Twentieth Corps crossed at Bridgeport on a
bridge constructed by them of pontoons and tressels;
it was 2,700 feet long. Baird’s—formerly
Rousseau’s—and Negley’s divisions of the Fourteenth
Corps followed Sheridan’s division. The
Twenty-first Corps marched down the Sequatchie
Valley and crossed at Battle Creek, nine
miles up the river from Bridgeport. Hazen’s,
Wagner’s, and Wilder’s brigades were, as before
mentioned, in the Tennessee Valley to the north
of Chattanooga, and did not cross with their corps.
The whole movement across the river began on
August 29 and ended on September 4. The
Third brigade of Van Cleve’s division of the
Twenty-first Corps was left at McMinnville as a
garrison. The railway was protected by the reserve
corps; the Fourteenth Corps was ordered to
concentrate in Lookout Valley and to send immediate
detachments to seize Cooper’s and Stevens’s
gaps of Lookout Mountain, the only passable
routes to McLemore’s Cove, down which runs the
west Chickamauga Creek in a northeasterly direction,
towards Chattanooga. The Twentieth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Corps was to move to Valley Head at the head of
Lookout Valley, and seize Winston’s Gap forty
miles south of Chattanooga. The Twenty-first
Corps with the exception of Hazen’s and Wagner’s
infantry and Minty’s cavalry—which were
still north and east of Chattanooga—were to
march to Wauhatchie, at the lower end of Lookout
Valley, near Lookout Mountain, and to communicate
with the Fourteenth Corps at Trenton
in the same valley, and threaten Chattanooga by
way of the Tennessee River via the nose of Lookout
Mountain. The cavalry crossed at Caperton’s
and at a ford near Island Creek, in Lookout
Valley, from which point they reconnoitered
towards Rome, Georgia, fifty-five miles south
of Chattanooga, via Alpine. This last mentioned
hamlet is forty-two miles south of
Chattanooga. In the absence of Major-General
Stanley—the chief of cavalry—its movements
were not prompt. If the reader will refer to a
good topographical map of the region around
Chattanooga, he will see how sagacious these
movements were, and what grand strategy they
displayed. The Army of the Cumberland was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
stretched in line through the whole length of Lookout
Valley, between Sand Mountain and Lookout
Mountain, on the south side of the Tennessee
River; it faced east towards the Chattanooga
Valley, with only one range between them and
the Confederate line of retreat and supplies; while
on the northeast side of Chattanooga was a Union
force of several brigades to prevent any counter
movement by the Confederates upon the Union
line of supplies.</p>

<p>After crossing the Tennessee River, Rosecrans
continued his feints to make Bragg think that the
real movement was the feigned one. He had sent
Wagner’s infantry, and Wilder’s and Minty’s
cavalry brigades to report to Hazen with a force
amounting to about 7,000. Hazen caused the
enemy to believe that the whole army was there,
intending to cross the river above Chattanooga.
This was done by extensive firings, marchings,
countermarchings, and by bugle calls, at widely
separated points; while Wilder moved his artillery
continuously across openings in sight from the
opposite bank.</p>

<p>The Confederates occupied in force the point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of Lookout Mountain at Chattanooga. To carry
this by an attack of the Twenty-first Corps seemed
too risky; therefore the original movement was
continued, namely, against the line south of Chattanooga,
over Lookout Ridge, south of the point
where it was held in force. The cavalry was ordered
to advance on the extreme right to Summerville,
in Broomtown Valley, a village eighteen
miles south of Lafayette, Georgia. McCook
was to support this movement by a division thrown
forward to the vicinity of Alpine forty-two miles
southwest of Chattanooga. These movements
were made on September 8 and 9.</p>

<p>General Thomas crossed his corps over Frick’s,
Cooper’s, and Stevens’s gaps of Lookout Mountain,
to McLemore’s Cove.</p>

<p>These movements forced Bragg to evacuate
Chattanooga on September 8. Then Crittenden
with the Twenty-first Corps and its trains marched
the same day around the point of Lookout and
camped that night at Rossville, at the gap through
Missionary Ridge, five miles south of Chattanooga.
Through this gap runs the wagon road
from Lafayette to Chattanooga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>General Rosecrans claimed to have evidence
that Bragg was moving towards Rome, and had
therefore ordered Crittenden to hold Chattanooga
with one brigade, call all the troops of Hazen’s
command across from the north side of the river,
an follow the enemy’s retreat vigorously.</p>

<p>On September 11, Crittenden was ordered to
advance as far as Ringgold, but not farther, and
to make a reconnoisance as far as Lee and Gordon’s
Mill.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Crittenden’s report as well as other
evidence convinced General Rosecrans that Bragg
had only gone as far as Lafayette—twenty-five
miles south of Chattanooga—and then halted.
General Crittenden’s whole corps was therefore
sent to Lee and Gordon’s Mill, where he found
Bragg’s rear guard. He was ordered to communicate
with General Thomas, who by that time
had reached the eastern foot of Lookout Mountain
in McLemore’s Cove, at the eastern base of
Stevens’s gap. Wilder’s mounted brigade followed
and covered the Twenty-first Corps in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
movements to Lee and Gordon’s Mill, and had a
severe fight with the enemy at Leet’s tan yard, five
miles to the southeast. Although Bragg made
his headquarters at Lafayette in his retreat from
Chattanooga, his rear guard did not get beyond
Lee and Gordon’s Mill.</p>

<p>On September 10 Negley’s division of the
Fourteenth Corps marched—after having crossed
the ridge—from the foot of Stevens’s Gap, across
McLemore’s Cove, towards Dug Gap in the
Pigeon Mountains and then directly towards Lafayette.
Dug Gap is six miles west of Lafayette.
Negley found this gap heavily obstructed, but
Baird’s division came to his support on the morning
of September 11. They became convinced by
some sharp skirmishing, which occurred on the
11th, that the enemy’s forces were advancing;
and therefore fell back from Davis’s cross roads to
a good position near the foot of Stevens’s Gap.
These two officers are entitled to great credit for
their coolness and skill in withdrawing their divisions
from a very perilous trap. The forces of the
enemy would have been overwhelming in their
immediate front, if the Confederates had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
more expeditious and made the attack on the afternoon
of September 10 or on the morning of the
11th. Hindman, Buckner, and Cleburne, with
several divisions were there, but failed to cooperate
in an attack at the right time. The obstructions
placed in the gap by the Confederates favored
Negley and Baird.</p>

<p>On September 12 Reynolds’s and Brannan’s
divisions following over the mountain closed up
to Negley and Baird. Bragg’s army was at
Lafayette, near Dug Gap, in force. Having official
information that Longstreet was coming from
Virginia with large reinforcements, and having
already received troops from Mississippi and the
eastern part of Tennessee, Bragg halted in his retreat.
He was preparing to give battle to the
Union forces at the first good opportunity.</p>

<p>Two divisions of Joseph E. Johnston’s troops
from Mississippi and Buckner’s Corps from Tennessee—where
Burnside’s forces were—had joined
Bragg before he moved north from Lafayette
to Chickamauga, where he was joined by three
divisions of Longstreet’s Corps from Virginia on
the 18th, if not earlier. At the same time Halleck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
chief of the army at Washington, D. C.,
telegraphed Rosecrans September 11, 1863, as
follows: “It is reported here by deserters that a
part of Bragg’s army is reinforcing Lee. It is important
that the truth of this should be ascertained
as early as possible.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The fact stands out in bold relief, that the Confederate
Government at Richmond hastened reinforcements
to General Bragg; while the Washington
Government sent none to Rosecrans, although
Burnside was in the eastern part of Tennessee
with 16,000 troops, and was at that time at
leisure. Because the force, lately in his front, had
reinforced Bragg at Lafayette, Burnside did
not obey Halleck’s order to join Rosecrans; on the
contrary, he drove Buckner’s force, which united
with Bragg; thus Burnside enabled Buckner’s men
to take part against the Union Army in the battle
of Chickamauga.</p>

<p>Bragg in his official report, says: “During the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
9th it was ascertained that a column, estimated
at from 4,000 to 8,000 had crossed Lookout
Mountain into the cove by way of Cooper’s
and Stevens’s gaps. Thrown off his guard by
our rapid movement, apparently in retreat, when
in reality we had concentrated opposite his center,
and deceived by the information, by deserters and
others sent into his lines, the enemy pressed on his
columns to intercept us, and thus exposed himself
in detail.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He says further that he ordered
Hindman, Cleburne, and Buckner to join
and attack the forces—Negley and Baird—at
Davis’s cross roads, near Dug Gap; but because
Dug Gap was obstructed by felled timber, which
required twenty-four hours to remove, and because
Buckner, when he joined Hindman, wanted to
change the plans, Negley and Baird had been allowed
to move back in a position not wise to follow.
Bragg drew Buckner, Hindman, and Cleburne
back to Lafayette and prepared to move in
order to attack Crittenden at Lee and Gordon’s
Mill. Polk’s and Walker’s corps were moved
immediately in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>The only Wisconsin troops in the affair at Dug
Gap on September 10 and 11 were the First,
Tenth, and Twenty-first Infantry. Lieutenant
Robert J. Nickles of the First Wisconsin Infantry,
aide to General J. C. Starkweather, commanding
the brigade, was killed when reconnoitering
alone the enemy’s skirmishers. This was the
only casualty to the Wisconsin troops.</p>

<p>On September 12, General Leonidas Polk was
ordered to attack Crittenden the next day, at Lee
and Gordon’s Mill. Polk would not attack
however, without reinforcements. Bragg spent
the next five days getting his army in position along
the west Chickamauga Creek, and on its east side
from the north end of Pigeon Mountains to Reed’s
Bridge. Brigadier-General B. R. Johnson, who
had been holding Ringgold on the east side of the
Chickamauga with one brigade, moved on the
18th to Reed’s Bridge on the west Chickamauga;
this caused his force to become the extreme right
of Bragg’s line. While Forrest’s and Pegram’s
cavalry covered the extreme right at Reed’s
Bridge, Walker’s Corps formed on the left of B.
R. Johnson’s, opposite Alexander’s Bridge; Buckner’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
was next to Thedford’s Ford; Polk’s opposite
Lee and Gordon’s Mill, and Hill’s Corps was
on the extreme left, near Glass’s Mill. Wheeler’s
Cavalry protected the left flank, and was ordered
to annoy the troops in McLemore’s Cove so much
that Bragg’s movement would not be discovered.
With B. R. Johnson’s movement from Ringgold
came two brigades—just arrived from Mississippi—and
three of Longstreet’s from Virginia.
The other two brigades from Virginia came on
the 19th in time to take active part, the Confederate
Army being in position on the east side of
west Chickamauga Creek; and Crittenden’s Corps
near Lee and Gordon’s Mill on the west side.
Bragg was finally ready for attack; and on the
night of the 17th issued his order of battle,
namely, that each body of troops should cross the
creek at the nearest practicable bridge or ford, turn
to the left, and sweep up the Chickamauga towards
Lee and Gordon’s Mill. This would
bring the troops upon the left flank of Crittenden’s
forces. Leonidas Polk was to attack in front,
across the stream, while Hill was ordered to prevent
the Union forces in McLemore’s Cove from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
reinforcing Crittenden. It will be seen how
Bragg’s plan of attack failed completely. The
Chickamauga Creek or River rises at the head of
McLemore’s Cove, and runs northeast, emptying
into the Tennessee River about five miles above
Chattanooga. Therefore, to retreat to Chattanooga,
or to cut off the Union Army from it, the
Confederate Army had to cross on the west side
of Chickamauga. The road from Lafayette
to Chattanooga—on which the Confederates
marched—runs on the east side of and parallel
with Pigeon Mountains and the river, and crosses
the river at Lee and Gordon’s Mill. The road on
which the Union troops at Stevens’s gap marched,
runs down the cove on the west side of the river and
Pigeon Mountains, past Crawfish Springs, near
which it branches to McFarland’s Gap and to
Kelly’s farm on the Lafayette road, three miles
north of Lee and Gordon’s; this distance is about
sixteen miles. The Pigeon Mountains dwindle
away into the level country some miles south of
Lee and Gordon’s.</p>

<p>The order of battle issued by Bragg on September
17, was not immediately executed, on account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
of some resistance made by Wilder’s mounted
infantry and Minty’s cavalry at Reed’s and
Alexander’s bridges.</p>

<p>The activity of Minty and Wilder, and the
bold front shown by the troops of Crittenden at
and about Lee and Gordon’s Mill, prevented a
serious attack by General Leonidas Polk, who was
in front of that position. These facts together
with the affair at Dug Gap and the presence
of McCook’s Corps at Alpine caused the Confederate
Army to hesitate; thus General Rosecrans
was given time to concentrate his whole army—not
Crittenden’s Corps only—at Chickamauga, across
the Lafayette road, between the Confederate
Army and Chattanooga. Bragg’s plan was to attack
Crittenden’s left and rear, throwing it back
upon the centre—General Thomas’s—before Crittenden
could be reinforced, and then to thrust
his army between Rosecrans and Chattanooga.
Rosecrans’s plan was to prevent such a disaster.
Late in the afternoon of September 18, the first
Confederate troops crossed the Chickamauga towards
the west; this movement was still going on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
on the morning of the 19th, when something unexpected
happened to Bragg’s Army.</p>

<p>About two-thirds of the Confederate Army
had crossed and was facing towards Lee and
Gordon’s Mill, when at 9 o’clock a brisk engagement
commenced with Forrest’s cavalry on the
right of the Confederate line at Jay’s Mill, near
Reed’s Bridge.</p>

<p>While these movements of the Confederate
Army were being inaugurated from Lafayette
down on the east side of Chickamauga, the Union
Army, at the foot of Stevens’s Gap in the cove and
McCook’s Twentieth Corps, twenty miles away
near Alpine, had to get together and join Crittenden’s
Twenty-first Corps at Lee and Gordon’s
Mill.</p>

<p>While waiting to receive sufficient information
to convince him that Bragg had halted at Lafayette,
Rosecrans had on September 11 or 12 greatly
widened the distance between his corps. It was a
very dangerous maneuver to face Bragg, and had
a more enterprising general been in command of
the Confederate Army, the result would probably
have been fatal for the Union forces. General D.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
H. Hill says in a <i>Century Magazine</i> article, that
Bragg was confused by the rapid movements of
the Union Corps; the presence of McCook’s
Corps, south of Lafayette, at Alpine, held Bragg
for a while at that place. He was not well informed
as to the movements of Rosecrans’s
Army.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Bragg, by failing to attack the detached Fourteenth
Corps nearest him in McLemore’s Cove,
and afterwards to march towards the more distant
detached Twenty-first Corps at Lee and Gordon’s
gave the Union commander an opportunity to
concentrate, and place his united army across the
road from Lafayette to Chattanooga, at Kelly’s
farm between Rossville and Lee and Gordon’s
Mill. How was this movement done?</p>

<p>While it took Bragg five days—from September
12 to 17—to concentrate his army from Lafayette
and Ringgold near Lee and Gordon’s, it
required the same length of time for McCook to
march his corps from the vicinity of Alpine to connect
it with Thomas at the foot of Stevens’s Gap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in the cove. There was a distance of forty miles
from flank to flank of the Union Army, that is,
from Alpine to Lee and Gordon’s. But McCook
marched fifty-seven miles by the route he took in
order to connect with Thomas. General Rosecrans
in his official report says: “He [General
McCook] had, with great prudence, already
moved his trains back to the rear of Little River, on
the mountain, but unfortunately, being ignorant of
the mountain road, moved down the mountain at
Winston’s Gap, down Lookout Valley to Cooper’s
Gap, up the mountain, and down again, closing
up with General Thomas on the 17th.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Looking back at this scattering of Rosecrans’s
forces by the sending of McCook’s Corps to Alpine—twenty
miles southwest of Lafayette—one can
understand that such tactics were serious mistakes.
General Rosecrans thought himself justified for the
movement upon the supposed correctness of the information
he had received, namely, that Bragg’s
Army was in full retreat towards Rome, Georgia.
It is apparent, however, that a reconnoisance of the
cavalry to Alpine and Summerville would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
accomplished the same result as the corps of infantry
which was sent. The alternative before Rosecrans,
when he discovered the retreat of the Confederate
Army, was to concentrate the Fourteenth
and Twentieth corps at Chattanooga, occupy
Rossville Gap with a strong outpost, well entrenched,
and Lookout Mountain with another entrenched
detachment; he could then have waited
for further developments. It is hardly probable
that Bragg would have attacked him after having
received his reinforcements, but would perhaps
have fallen back on his line of supplies at some
point in the rear. Before that could have occurred,
however, the reinforcements that Rosecrans afterwards
received would have been able to protect
his line of communications.</p>

<p>By the evening of the 17th the Union troops
were substantially within supporting distance, but
not yet in line to resist an attack by the enemy upon
Crittenden at Lee and Gordon’s, but orders were
immediately given to move the Fourteenth and
Twentieth corps towards the northeast, down the
west Chickamauga River, in order to cover the
Lafayette road, somewhere near Crittenden’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Corps. The position of the troops and narrowness
of the roads retarded the march.</p>

<p>It must be kept in mind, that the movements
which Rosecrans made after he discovered that
Bragg had halted at Lafayette, were for the purpose
of concentrating upon Chattanooga; and that
the route Rosecrans took after the junction of the
Fourteenth and Twentieth corps was perhaps the
shortest route he could take to Chattanooga, while
he could at the same time watch the enemy. He
encountered Bragg’s force at Chickamauga and
was forced to fight there. This was, therefore,
the battle for Chattanooga. He gained his point—the
military occupancy of Chattanooga—but it
required two battles to win it; those of Chickamauga
and the three days fight immediately
around Chattanooga.</p>

<p>During the 18th Minty’s cavalry, in position
east of Reed’s Bridge, was attacked by Bushrod
Johnson’s troops coming from Ringgold, and
Wilder’s mounted infantry at Alexander’s, by
Walker’s Corps. Both were holding bridges, but
were driven back into the Lafayette road. General
Rosecrans’s plan, as given in orders, was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
General Thomas on his way down the cove road
passing Crawfish Springs, near the battlefield,
should post General Negley’s division there, relieving
two divisions of Crittenden’s Corps. With
the remainder of his corps, he was to march by
way of Widow Glenn’s house to the Lafayette
road, and take position at Kelly’s farm, across
this road. General Crittenden was to move
Palmer’s and Van Cleve’s divisions, relieved
by Negley, to the left of his line, and with
them prolong his left, from the left of Wood’s
division, so as to cover that part of the Lafayette
road, near Lee and Gordon’s. McCook’s Corps
was to follow General Thomas and take temporary
position at Crawfish Springs, protecting the
right of the Union line, and to keep his corps
mainly in reserve.</p>

<p>The cavalry was to close on McCook’s right,
and to watch the crossings of the Chickamauga in
that region.</p>

<p>The Union movements began on the morning of
the 18th, but were so slow, that McCook’s Corps
only reached Pond Spring at dark, and bivouaced
there for the night. Crittenden’s two divisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
reached their positions on the Lafayette road near
midnight. In view of the accumulated evidence,
that the enemy was crossing his forces over the
Chickamauga below Lee and Gordon’s on the
18th, General Thomas pushed forward his corps,
uninterruptedly during the night. He halted his
leading division—Negley’s—at the assigned position
near Crawfish Springs, where his corps rested
for two hours at midnight and made coffee. From
there on Baird’s division was in the lead, and
General Thomas and staff rode with General
Baird at the head of the column. This was a
weird night-march. The utmost secrecy was
kept. If the enemy—who was just across the
river not far away—had discovered the movement,
he would perhaps also have marched in the night
and occupied the place for which General Thomas
was aiming. General Hill’s Corps and Wheeler’s
Cavalry of the Confederate Army were on
the east side of the Chickamauga, in order to prevent
the Fourteenth and Twentieth corps from
making this march. To deceive the enemy campfires
were left burning in the camps in the early
evening; in fact all along the road southwest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Crawfish Springs, frequent fires were kindled.
Soon after leaving Crawfish Springs the column
deflected to the right into an obscure cross-country
road, which led to Kelly’s farm. Along the
windings of this road, some of the hardest fights
of the 19th and 20th took place. A pond afterwards
known as “bloody pond” was passed soon
after leaving Crawfish Springs; to the left, and
a short distance from this pond, General William
H. Lytle was killed September 20. Still further
on was the place where the fatal blunder of the
20th occurred—at about 11 a. m.—near Brotherton’s
house; General T. J. Wood, obeying his
interpretation of an order from General Rosecrans,
having withdrawn from the line, let in Longstreet’s
troops.</p>

<p>This road runs almost entirely through thick
hardwood timber, but about half way between
Crawfish Springs and Kelly’s farm, there was a
little dwelling in the midst of a clearing, known
as Widow Glenn’s. Here the next day, General
Rosecrans lifted the name of the widow from the
depths of utter obscurity to the heights of national
fame, by making her home his headquarters. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
fact, the whole region from Missionary Ridge, on
the left of the marching column as far as Rossville
Gap (four miles to the northwest) to the
Chickamauga on the east, was densely wooded
and covered with heavy undergrowth. A few
small farms scattered through this woodland were
tilled by the obscurest of backwoodsmen, who
lived in small log cabins or small frame buildings.
Their names would never have been known, even
in Chattanooga nine miles away, had it not been
for the accidental fighting there of the greatest
battle of the west. Widow Glenn’s, Kelly’s
farm, Snodgrass Hill, McDonald’s, Poe’s,
Brotherton’s, Dyer’s, Vittetoe’s, and Viniard’s
were suddenly made historical by the battle of
Chickamauga.</p>

<p>General George H. Thomas was a very sedate
man. There was about him, at all times, the very
atmosphere of solid merit and reserved strength.
As he rode beside General Baird, attended by
the two staff corps, there was no indication
that he was conscious of his high position. His
modesty was always conspicuous. No one in
the long line of troops stretching for miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
behind could see in this unpretentious officer
the true hero of the coming conflict, who would
be known in the future as the “Rock of
Chickamauga.” After Negley’s division was
left in position near Crawfish, there remained in
the marching column the three divisions of Baird,
Brannan, and Reynolds. Baird’s and Brannan’s
had three brigades each, but Reynolds’s had only
two; Wilder’s was mounted and operated as cavalry,
wherefore it was not always with its division.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i099.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Chickamauga, September 19, 1863</span><br />
Adapted from Fiske’s <i>The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War</i>, p. 266</p>

<p>About daylight on September 19, Baird’s division
filed across the Lafayette road near Kelly’s
log house, stacked arms, and commenced to prepare
breakfast. Forrest’s Confederate cavalry
lay at that time in the neighborhood of Jay’s Mill,
one mile to the east, near Reed’s Bridge; Hood’s
and Walker’s corps were further up, or west towards
Lee’s and Gordon’s and within a mile and
a half of Crittenden’s left. The stream was in
many places easily fordable. The whole Confederate
Army was across the Chickamauga at
sunrise with the exception of Hindman’s, Breckenridge’s,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>and Cleburne’s divisions. Thomas made
temporary headquarters under a large tree by the
roadside; while waiting for the closing up of the
rear division, he lay down on some blankets, and
told his aide not to let him sleep more than an hour.
General Gordon Granger, who commanded
the reserve corps, had been ordered by Rosecrans
on September 13 to bring three brigades of
this corps—which happened then to be at
Bridgeport, Alabama, guarding that point of the
Union line of supplies—to the Rossville Gap.
His duty was to guard the approaches from the
south and east and to <i>generally support the main
army</i>. He moved with his usual energy and arrived
at the gap on September 14, although the
distance is about thirty-five miles. He brought
with him two brigades of Steedman’s division,
viz.: Mitchell’s and Whittaker’s, and Daniel McCook’s
brigades of James D. Morgan’s division.
Granger’s presence in the front of Rossville Gap at
McAffee’s Church with Whittaker’s brigade, and
his sending Daniel McCook’s and Mitchell’s
brigades towards Jay’s Mill and Reed’s Bridge,
assisted greatly in postponing the crossing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Confederate forces until the 18th and thus preventing
an attack on Crittenden’s left flank.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 19th McCook’s brigade
was bivouacing somewhere near Reed’s Bridge.
McCook rode over to where Thomas was, and
said hurriedly he must speak to him. He told
General Thomas that a Confederate brigade had
crossed at Reed’s Bridge and that his (own)
brigade had then burned this bridge, thus this detached
brigade could be captured, if General
Thomas would send forces enough to do it. At
that moment the head of Brannan’s division was
approaching in rear of the line of Baird’s division
to take position on the latter’s left. Thomas ordered
Brannan to reconnoitre in that direction with
two brigades and to attack any force met. His
advance brigade—Croxton’s—encountered very
soon Forrest’s cavalry, about 7:30 or 8 a. m. (some
reports say 9 a. m.) and drove it more than half
a mile. “This vigorous movement disconcerted
the plans of the enemy to move on our left and
opened the battle of the 19th September,” says
General Rosecrans in his official report.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Forrest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
was in that place as a defense of Bragg’s right
flank. The sudden musketry of Croxton’s attack
on Forrest far to the right of the Confederate
commanders startled them and gave them the first
intimation, that Bragg’s order did not meet the
situation.</p>

<p>General H. V. Boynton says that, at the time
the isolated Confederate brigade was reported as
on the west side of Chickamauga, early in the
morning of September 19, two-thirds of the Confederate
Army were on the west side.</p>

<p>It was 6:30 a. m. when Brannan left Kelly’s
and moved north; he took the Reed’s Bridge road
for the capturing of the isolated brigade. It was
between 8 and 9 a. m., before the enemy was
struck.</p>

<p>General Forrest called immediately for assistance.
Ector’s and Wilson’s infantry brigades of
Walker’s Corps returned down the stream and
drove Croxton. This brought Brannan with his
two remaining brigades forward; he in turn drove
back the Confederate force. Brannan in his report<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
says, that his troops came upon a strong force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
of the enemy, consisting of two divisions instead
of the supposed brigade. Very soon Baird’s division
was sent in on the right of Brannan; this at first
drove the Confederate force that was attacking
Brannan, but in turn it was attacked directly on its
right flank and rear by Liddell’s division, which
threw it into temporary confusion. In the meantime
McCook’s Corps arrived on the field. R.
W. Johnson’s division of that corps was sent in,
at noon, on Baird’s right; it struck Cheatham’s
division on its right flank, driving it back in confusion.
Johnson’s was overlapped and in immediate
danger, when General John M. Palmer’s division
of Crittenden’s Corps, relieved the right of his division;
Crittenden had very wisely dispatched Palmer’s
division toward the sound of the firing and this
burst upon the enemy. Palmer’s right was soon
overlapped when Van Cleve from Crittenden’s
Corps came to the rescue, but later in the day he
also was beaten back. Then Reynolds’s division
of Thomas’s corps advanced on the left of Palmer’s
division, and two brigades of Van Cleve’s
division came in on Palmer’s right. Davis’s division
of McCook’s Corps attacked most opportunely and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
drove the enemy, but was compelled somewhat
to give way. In this attack Colonel Hans C.
Heg of the Fifteenth Wisconsin Infantry was
mortally wounded. In the meantime Crittenden’s
remaining division under Wood attacked the
Confederates and turned the tide. Lee and
Gordon’s Mill was at that moment uncovered,
all of Crittenden’s Corps having marched towards
the left. About 3 o’clock p. m. McCook was ordered
to send his remaining division (Sheridan’s)
to support the line near Wood and Davis, and to
place Lytle’s brigade at Lee and Gordon’s as the
extreme right. This stayed the Confederate advance
in that section.</p>

<p>Lytle’s brigade was considered sufficient
at that time to hold a point against which Bragg
was, at first, directing his whole force. This
point—at Lee and Gordon’s—was the left of
the Union Army on the 18th; at noon on the 19th
it was the right.</p>

<p>Negley’s division, which had been posted near
Crawfish Springs the night before, was then the
only Union division which did not partake in the
battle at first, but arrived in accordance with orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
on the field about 4:30 p. m. He was ordered to
the place, from which Van Cleve had been driven,
in order to attack; he drove the enemy steadily,
while Thomas was driving him on the Confederate
right; these movements continued until night.</p>

<p>It can readily be perceived that the battle of the
19th was more or less a haphazard fight, neither
side being aware of the position of the other. The
undergrowth of the woods was so dense in most
places, that opposed sides could not perceive each
other until they were within a few yards, except by
the firing. It was unfortunate that Rosecrans was
not present with Thomas, when the latter’s corps
crossed the Lafayette road. Before an attack was
made, the Twenty-first Corps, being the nearest
one to the Fourteenth, should have been formed
on the right of the Fourteenth, both in a compact
line, and with a brigade for each division
in reserve; and the Twentieth Corps—when it
closed up on the right of the Twenty-first in the
same compact order—should have advanced
swiftly upon the Confederates, some of whom
were still crossing the river, and some with their
right flanks to the Union line of attack. It is possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
that such an attack would have driven the
Confederates into the river in great confusion; but
an attack by only one division (Brannan’s) on
Forrest’s cavalry beyond the Confederate right
flank, simply notified the Confederate commanders,
and gave them ample time to wheel their divisions
into the proper direction, and signalled them
where to attack. General Rosecrans in his report
does not mention a night fight that occurred on the
extreme Union left. In fact, he says, there was
no firing after dark. Just as it began to grow
dark, however, Cleburne’s division of Hill’s Corps
arrived from across the river. He boldly and
characteristically marched through the defeated
and prostrated divisions of Walker and Cheatham,
was joined by two brigades of Cheatham’s division,
Jackson’s, and Preston Smith’s, and then attacked
with great fierceness the Union troops under
R. W. Johnson and Baird; they covered Johnson’s
front and lapped over on Baird. It was too dark
to recognize friend from foe, and it was more or
less a hand-to-hand contest. Finally the attack
was repulsed, the Union troops holding the field.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
The Confederate general, Preston Smith, and two
of his staff officers were killed.</p>

<p>Some idea of the severity of the fighting on the
19th—the charging and falling back of both
sides; the difficulty in keeping alignments; the impossibility
of officers identifying friend or foe; the
losing of artillery batteries and single pieces, their
recapture; and the awful slaughter in both armies—can
be obtained only by reading official reports
in serial numbers 50 and 51 of <i>Rebellion Records</i>.
Its intensity can be estimated from the following
data. Breckenridge’s division was not in the
fight of September 19, but fought on the 20th
only; his loss in killed and wounded was 1,075.
Cleburne was in the night fight of the 19th, and
was as active as Breckenridge on the 20th; his
loss was 1,743 in killed and wounded. The
total difference of 668 does not give an accurate
comparison of the two days’ fighting, but does give
some idea of the awful slaughter. The battle of
the 19th was fought without breastworks; it was a
square stand-up fight; nearly every division engaged
on both sides, first attacked, then drove its
opponent, and after falling back in some disorder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
reformed, and again advanced, until the day and
part of the night were gone.</p>

<p>The surgeon-general of the Union Army reported
that about 4,500 wounded were treated after
this battle of the 19th. The loss in killed and
wounded must, therefore, have reached 6,000, but
the Union reports do not separate the losses of the
19th from the total.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the 19th, Brannan’s
division was withdrawn from the left and placed
in reserve, or rather in echelon at the right of Reynolds,
near Brotherton’s house, at the right of
Thomas’s line.</p>

<p>During the night of the 19th the lines of both
armies were readjusted. That of the Union Army
was drawn back. Palmer of Crittenden’s Corps
and Johnson of McCook’s, who had reported to
General Thomas the day before, were ordered to
remain under his direction. He placed his troops
in a compact line—facing east with the Lafayette
road in his rear—around Kelly’s farm, but some
distance in the woods. The divisions were in the
following order from left to right: Baird, Johnson,
Palmer, Reynolds, and Brannan; Brannan was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
drawn back so far, however, that he could be available
as a reserve and at the same time close enough
to advance quickly to the front line. The right
and left were both refused. Baird had no reserve;
but Johnson and Palmer had each a brigade
in reserve. Each division was formed in two
lines, and both were protected by hastily thrown
up log breastworks. The artillery was in battery
between brigades; this line was not broken during
the battle of the 20th. Reynolds’s line crossed the
Lafayette road at Poe’s house, near Brotherton’s,
and from there to Lee and Gordon’s neither of the
armies was in possession of the road. Reynolds
had Turchin’s brigade in line and King’s in reserve.
Baird’s left did not reach to the Lafayette
road. Kelly Field, which was a parallelogram
about half a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide,
was the storm centre of battle during September
20. Besides the immense fighting along the main
line of log works, there were five different charges,
in rear of the main line from the south to the north
side by five different Union brigades. These
charges were made against the Confederate troops,
which had turned on the left of Baird’s line and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
gained his rear. The brigades of Stanley, Van
Derveer, Gross, Willich, and Turchin made these
charges.</p>

<p>The right of the Union line on the 20th—from
Brannan’s right—was neither compact nor protected.
During the night of the 19th, or early
morning of the 20th, the four divisions of Sheridan,
Davis, Wood, and Van Cleve had been moved to
the eastern slope of Missionary Ridge, a mile or
more from the Lafayette road, in order to cover the
road leading from Crawfish Springs to McFarland’s
Gap, west of Rosecrans’s headquarters.
General Rosecrans says he rode the line about
daylight, and that he suggested certain changes to
McCook, especially that he keep close to the left,
which was not done, however, in time to prevent
disaster. Negley of the Fourteenth Corps, who
was in line on the right adjoining Brannan, was ordered
to proceed to Thomas’s left, but only two
brigades, John Beatty’s and Stanley’s, arrived, one
at a time; both were driven away by the enemy.
John Beatty’s brigade—which at 8:30 a. m. was
placed on the left of Baird, so as to reach the Lafayette
road—was not fortified; its thin line was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
swept away at the first attack by the enemy.
Negley was expected to fill this gap with his whole
division, and Thomas sent request after request for
Negley’s division. There was so much re-adjustment
going on at the wrong time, and much of it
not going on at any time in the troops under McCook
and Crittenden on the 20th, that it is difficult
now to try to place them up to 11 a. m. Wood,
with his two brigades from the reserve, relieved
Negley’s two remaining brigades in the front line,
next to Brannan’s about 9:30 a. m., his brigade being
a little withdrawn in echelon. This was done
to enable Negley to take position on Baird’s left.
About 11 a. m. Van Cleve marched to the rear of
Wood and had his men lie down. All these
troops on the right—from Reynolds’s right to
Sheridan’s the extreme right of the Union Army—were
very thinly drawn out, and did no good in the
day’s fight, with the exception of one full brigade
of Wood’s, namely, Harker’s, one regiment of
Buell’s brigade, and a few regiments from other
divisions, which will be mentioned further on.
The troops had done excellent service the day before;
but future events will show that they seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
to be paralyzed, by not having been well fortified
and compactly placed the night before. This
mistake had been corrected to some extent, when
the disaster came. On the 20th the troops faced
Longstreet, a most sagacious general, who was exceedingly
energetic in taking advantage of every
defect of his opponent’s line and every blunder in
his maneuvers.</p>

<p>McCook had Davis’s and Sheridan’s divisions
still on his extreme right. Crittenden had Van
Cleve’s and Wood’s, although the latter was in the
early morning supposed to be in reserve. Wood
came into the front line as stated, but Van Cleve
seems not to have found a place there on the 20th.</p>

<h3>THE CONFEDERATE LINE ON SEPTEMBER 20</h3>

<p>The Confederate line was in admirable formation
on the morning of the 20th, at a distance of
400 to 1,000 yards east of the Lafayette road.
From its right to its left it may be described as follows:
General Leonidas Polk commanded the
right wing which was formed as follows: Forrest’s
cavalry on the extreme right, 3,500 strong, a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
part of it dismounted; and next to him Breckenridge’s
division. The cavalry and two infantry
brigades of Breckenridge’s extended beyond
Baird’s left; next in line came Cleburne’s division,
in reserve behind Breckenridge was Walker’s two
divisions of five brigades.</p>

<p>General Longstreet commanded the left wing
of the Confederate Army. This began at Cleburne’s
left with Stewart’s division opposite Palmer’s
and Reynolds’s; then came B. R. Johnson’s
opposite Brannan’s and Wood’s; next in line came
Hindman’s, just opposite to Davis, and Sheridan’s,
and in reserve behind Hindman’s was Preston’s.
In reserve behind B. R. Johnson’s were Law’s or
Hood’s—until Hood was wounded—and Kershaw’s
five brigades in both. Cheatham’s five
brigades were in reserve behind Stewart’s right, but
fought only the Union left, both on the 19th and
20th. At 3:30 p. m. Cheatham went to the extreme
right of the Confederate Army. The
strength of the whole Confederate formation lay
in its reserves; they were used with consummate
ability. The only reserves on the right wing of
the Union Army at the time of the Confederate assault<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
was Van Cleve’s division—which as an organized
division did not fight on the 20th—and
Wilder’s mounted brigade.</p>

<p>Longstreet had brought with him from Virginia
two divisions of Hood’s Corps—McLaws’s and
Law’s. Of McLaws’s division only Kershaw’s
and Humphreys’s brigades arrived in time to take
part in the battle of Chickamauga. Law had
three brigades in his division. These were Robertson’s,
Benning’s, and another, later commanded
by Colonel James L. Sheffield.</p>

<p>Bushrod R. Johnson’s division belonged to
Buckner’s Corps from East Tennessee. Buckner’s
Corps included also Stewart’s and Preston’s
divisions. These were not together during the
battle, but were presumably under direct command
of General Longstreet. The condition of Leonidas
Polk’s old corps, was almost similar. Cheatham’s
division of five brigades, and Hindman’s of
three brigades—of Polk’s former corps—were separated,
and operated in different parts of the field.
Daniel H. Hill’s Corps consisted of Cleburne’s
and Breckenridge’s divisions; these acted together,
commanded by Hill in person. General W. H.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
T. Walker’s Corps was composed of his old division,
commanded by General State Rights Gist,
and Liddell’s division consisting of two brigades—Govan’s
and Walthall’s.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i117.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Chickamauga, morning of September 20, 1863</span><br />
Adapted from Fiske’s <i>The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War</i>, p. 268</p>

<p>It will be understood that the Confederate forces
were large, strongly organized, well officered, and
extremely well placed on the field. Since falling
back from Tullahoma the following reinforcements
had joined Bragg: Walker’s five brigades
from Mississippi, Buckner’s six brigades from East
Tennessee, and Hood’s five brigades from Virginia,
besides a large amount of artillery. The
coming of General Longstreet from Virginia was
a distinct assistance to the Confederate Army.
He was a genuine soldier of great ability, and
capable of commanding his soldiers, clearly shown
when he handled the left Confederate wing on the
20th. The contrast between him and Leonidas
Polk was very much in evidence on the 20th.
Longstreet was exceedingly strong, while Polk
was very weak. The Confederate right overlapped
the Union left and had the Union right
been as compactly drawn towards its left as it
should have been, the Confederate left would also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
have overlapped that flank. The Confederate
Army facing the Union forces on the morning
of the 20th was made up of eleven divisions of
infantry, and two of cavalry. General Rosecrans
had no cavalry on his left, and Wheeler’s Confederate
cavalry was at first on the east side of the
Chickamauga and afterwards on the west side,
watching Mitchell’s Union horsemen near Crawfish
Springs.</p>

<p>General Rosecrans had 141 regiments of infantry,
18 of cavalry, and 36 batteries. Bragg had
173 infantry regiments, 11 of cavalry—which
were dismounted and fought as infantry—28 cavalry
regiments, and 50 batteries.</p>

<p>The Union front of battle on the morning of the
20th, was about two and a half miles in length.
Although Bragg had ordered the attack to be
commenced on his right at daylight, and to be
continued towards the left, yet it was 9:30 o’clock
before Breckenridge advanced his three brigades,
Adams’s, Stovall’s, and Helm’s against the left of
Baird’s and John Beatty’s thin line beyond.
Adams’s brigade on the right crossed the Lafayette
road, and Stovall struck Beatty. The latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
had to give way, but inflicted terrible punishment
on the enemy.</p>

<p>Part of Stovall’s brigade came against the regular
brigade, but made no impression. Helm,
the left of Breckenridge’s line, attacked the right
of the regulars’, Scribner’s line. The Confederate
line was shattered and went to pieces.
Helm, in bravely trying to rally his men was
killed; two of Helm’s colonels were also killed,
and two others wounded.</p>

<p>Adams’s brigade was gaining the rear of
King, when Stanley’s brigade of Negley’s long
delayed division came into the Kelly field, and
formed at right angles with the road and the
Union line swept to the north, past King’s left,
charged into the woods upon Adams’s brigade,
and drove it away. Sometime during their attacks
Adams was wounded and taken prisoner. Breckenridge’s
attack was a failure, but the firing by the
infantry and the artillery was terrific while it
lasted. Cleburne’s division advanced while
Breckenridge was still in the fight; his attack covered
part of Baird’s and Johnson’s. Cleburne
was a very capable officer; brave to the utmost;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
still his attack completely failed. Polk’s brigade
of that division assaulted Starkweather. With regard
to this attack Polk states in his official report<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
“My line from right to left, soon became furiously
engaged, the enemy pouring a most destructive fire
of canister and musketry into my advancing line—so
terrible indeed, that my line could not advance
in face of it, but lying down, partially protected by
the crest of the hill, we continued the fight for an
hour and a half.”</p>

<p>Cleburne states in his report<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> “Polk’s brigade
and the right of Wood’s encountered the heaviest
artillery fire I have ever experienced. I was now
within short canister range of a line of log breastworks,
and a hurricane of shot and shell swept the
woods from the unseen enemy in my front.” This
charge was also a failure, but most destructive to
the Confederates. Wood reported<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> a loss in his
brigade of 96 killed and 680 wounded. The
great disparity of the wounded, in comparison with
the killed, showed that the Confederate lines did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
not get very close to the Union boys. The Union
forces were so pleased with having repulsed so
forceful an attack, that they sent forward a strong
skirmish line. General Hill—who was forming
from the reserves a stronger second attack—paused,
and concluded he would have to resist an
attack from the Union line.</p>

<p>Walker’s reserve corps of two divisions of five
brigades was therefore moved forward and distributed
along the broken points of the first line. During
the day successive charges were made from
Palmer’s position to the Union left, by ten Confederate
brigades along the Union line, which, however,
they could not penetrate, nor could they
get very close to the breastworks. Colquitt,
commander of one of these brigades, fell as
well as several of his officers, and General Deshler
of Cleburne’s division was killed. Govan of
Walker’s troops gained the rear of Baird’s division
by marching around Baird’s left and driving away
the thin unprotected Union line at that point.
This second advance—which was actually another
phase of the continuous attack from 9:30 to nearly
noon—had extended its right much further beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the Union left, and by a wide left wheel it
had straddled the Lafayette road. One brigade
on the right of the road, another on the left, boldly
threw out skirmishers and advanced towards General
Reynolds’s rear, beyond the Kelly house. It
was a very threatening and dangerous situation.
The Confederate line in front—from Baird around
to Brannan—opened a heavy fire upon the barricades.
It looked for a while, as if the movement
would succeed in destroying the heretofore invincible
line of General Thomas’s troops; but Thomas
saw every movement and knew the weakness of
the left beyond Baird. Brannan had a reserve
brigade—Fred Van Derveer’s—and this arrived
just in time to form in front of the Confederate brigades
in the Kelly field. It changed front under
fire, charged the Confederate line, broke it, and
finally drove it clear of the Union left. Then the
reserve brigade returned to a point near the Kelly
house. Van Derveer’s brigade had come, at this
time, with an order from General Rosecrans to
Brannan, to report his whole division to General
Thomas. It was under the supposition
that Brannan had done so, that Rosecrans soon after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
issued the fatal order to Wood to close up on
Reynolds. But the enemy had gained the line,
where Beatty had before stood. Palmer sent
his reserve brigade (Grose’s), in accordance
with General Thomas’s order; his brigade formed
double lines, and with cheers they charged into
the woods and the enemy was driven away.
Then Barnes, of Van Cleve’s division, was placed
on or near the left; the Union left was henceforth
safe.</p>

<h3>THE CONFEDERATE ATTACK UPON THE UNION RIGHT</h3>

<p>About 11 o’clock the successive attacks of the
Confederate divisions from the left to the right
had reached Longstreet’s wing; they were continued
with a charge by Stewart upon Reynolds’s
position; it involved Hazen or Palmer, who had
been transferred to the right of Reynolds and to
the left of Brannan. This was the beginning of
the general assault on the Union right, which came
so near being disastrous to General Rosecrans’s
army. This attack of Stewart’s took place at the
time when Adams and Stovall of Breckenridge’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
division were entering the open Kelly field upon
the Confederate right. General Stewart acknowledges,
in his report, that his charge was repulsed
with great slaughter. The division next to Stewart
took up the assault. It was Bushrod R. Johnson’s
supported by Law and Kershaw. Just before
this attack an aide of General Thomas had come to
General Rosecrans to ask again for support on the
left. In riding close to the line between General
Reynolds’s and General Brannan’s divisions he
observed that the latter—Brannan being in echelon
with Reynolds—did not make a continuous line,
but a broken one. The position of General Brannan
was nevertheless just as effective, and perhaps
more so, than if he had been in the main line.
General Thomas J. Wood’s division, which had
just replaced Negley’s division, was next to the
right of Brannan but in the main line; it joined,
however, its left to Brannan’s right; wherefore the
aide reported to General Rosecrans that Reynolds’s
right was unprotected. Brannan had been
ordered to go to General Thomas’s left, but on account
of being threatened with an attack on his
front he remained with two of his brigades, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
sent Van Derveer’s, his reserve brigade. Rosecrans
dictated at once an order to Wood, “to
close upon Reynolds as fast as possible and support
him.” Thereupon Wood withdrew from the line,
and marched to the rear of Brannan, just as the
Confederate charge, under B. R. Johnson, reached
its old front. Rosecrans issued his order to Wood
supposing that Brannan had gone with his whole
division to the Kelly field. Brannan reported what
action he had taken, and that Reynolds had approved
it. Rosecrans gave his approval instantly;
but the fatal order had been issued to Wood some
minutes before, and consequently his division was
moving out, just as the eight brigades made the attack.
Longstreet had massed these brigades opposite
the Union centre. They were formed in
three lines, lapped over the right of Brannan and
the left of Davis—whose division was on the right
of Wood—and moved close to the gap; they widened
the awful space left by Wood; the attack
struck Wood’s rear brigade (Buell’s) and shattered
it. Brannan who was a very able commander
threw back his right, but lost a part of Connell’s
brigade in this movement. With great skill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
and considerable deliberation he re-established his
line on the Horse Shoe Ridge, near the Snodgrass
house, on a line nearly perpendicular to the one
from which he had retreated. Although Wood’s
division was subjected to a heavy attack, he—with
the aid of General Thomas, who had just come
from the left wing—succeeded in establishing his
remaining troops in prolongation of Brannan’s new
line, and in reaching towards, but not entirely,
Reynolds’s right, which retired slightly. Hazen’s
brigade of Palmer’s division filled up the gap between
Reynolds and Wood, thus making the
Union line a nearly continuous one from Snodgrass
Hill to the left of Baird, where Barnes’s brigade
had taken position. The shape of the line
was that of a very flattened crescent, with the convex
side towards the enemy; it was greatly shortened,
however, by the losses of the 19th, and the
cutting off on the right of two whole divisions,
Davis’s and Sheridan’s, a part of Wood’s, and
some of Van Cleve’s. These were now beyond
the Confederate line and were attacked by heavy
forces while on the march, driving them from the
field. Negley with his remaining brigade was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
caught in the gap from whence he drifted towards
Brannan. General H. V. Boynton said about
this affair on this part of the field: “Negley,
gathering up much artillery, was ordered by
General Thomas to post it on the crest overlooking
the field in front of Baird’s left, but
instead he took it to Brannan’s right. This
was a good position for it and it could have been
of great service there later, when the Confederate
line made an advance to that point, but he retired
with it in haste toward Rossville, ordering all the
artillery to follow him, before he was attacked.”</p>

<p>Jefferson C. Davis was a fine and brave officer.
He had only two brigades, Carlin’s and Heg’s;
the latter was commanded by Martin, for Colonel
Heg had been mortally wounded the day before.
These brigades had done some wonderful fighting
on the day before, when they were greatly reduced.
After the break they could not stand against the
Confederate charge, wherefore they drifted
towards Rossville. Davis and Sheridan were
both on the move by the left flank closing up
toward the left, when the Confederate charge
struck them. Van Cleve with his remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
brigades in motion—Barnes had gone to the
left—was thrown into disorder by the rapid
dash of some artillery through the ranks, while
a portion of them rallied with Wood. General
Lytle of the Sheridan brigade was killed
while trying to rally his troops. These divisions
and brigades went back, together with Wilder’s
mounted brigade, carrying with them Generals
Rosecrans, McCook, and Crittenden, who at that
time were to the right of the break. The line of
their retreat was through McFarland’s Gap in Missionary
Ridge, south of Rossville. These troops
did not go further back than to Rossville, but
Rosecrans, McCook, and Crittenden kept on to
Chattanooga. Boynton says, that Sheridan’s division
was in good order when it arrived at Rossville.
Davis tried his best to reform his troops
near to McFarland’s Gap; he did march them
back to the field, but reached it too late in the
evening. In the neighborhood of the two gaps,
McFarland’s and Rossville, were some ten thousand
fugitive troops; the way was open for them to
have been led either to the right or to the left of the
Union line. But who was there who had rank and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
authority enough to lead them, while their army
and corps commanders were still further to the rear?
James A. Garfield, Gates P. Thruston, chief of
McCook’s staff, Surgeons Gross and Perkins,
medical directors of the Fourteenth and Twentieth
corps, rode back and joined General Thomas.
Sheridan was requested by Thruston, the adjutant-general
and chief of staff to General McCook, at
McFarland’s Gap—by a message from General
Thomas—to march to the latter’s relief, but he
insisted on marching back to Rossville and from
there taking the Lafayette road to the left flank of
the army.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This was a most out of the way road
to the battlefield. Sheridan wanted to report
quickly to General Thomas when the break occurred
and was doing that by way of Rossville.
It was dark before he arrived near to the left; the
Union troops had then begun the backwood movement.</p>

<p>After the second attack on the left by Walker’s
and Hill’s corps, Breckenridge again came in behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Baird, but was repulsed by Van Derveer,
Grose, and Willich. All was quiet on the left,
while heavy firing continued on the right, when
General Thomas rode over to the right to look at
matters there. This occurred during the adjustment
after the break, and he placed what remained
of Wood’s on the left of Brannan, the latter having
taken his position prior to that on Horse Shoe
Ridge. General Thomas did not return to the
left until about 5:30 p. m.</p>

<p>There had been no intimation to the four commanders
on the left—Baird, Johnson, Palmer, and
Reynolds—that everything had not gone well
with the right. They could get no message
from Thomas for two or three hours. At this
juncture, fearing another assault by the Confederate
lines, and supposing that Thomas had been
cut off from them, Palmer, Johnson, and Reynolds
consulted with Baird and proposed that General
Palmer, as the senior and ranking officer, be
placed in command of their four divisions and
march them off the field. General Baird refusing
to join them, prevented this calamity. Had
this been done, the Confederate right wing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
confronting them, could have advanced unimpeded
in the rear of the Union troops on Snodgrass
Hill, about three-quarters of a mile directly in
the rear of the Union left. In view of what happened
later in the evening with regard to the successful
falling back, it is not necessary to state
what a probable disaster General Baird prevented.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i133.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Fatal Order to Wood, at Chickamauga</span><br />
Adapted from Fiske’s <i>The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War</i>, p. 270</p>

<p>Longstreet followed the drawing back of the
Union right, by a right wheel of his divisions,
while keeping Preston’s division in reserve, probably
in order to be ready to repel quickly any attack
upon his left and rear by Davis, Sheridan,
Wilder, or R. B. Mitchell. There was no need
to be alarmed, for no troops approached from that
quarter. He largely outflanked and outnumbered
the right wing of Rosecrans. General Garfield
had brought an order to Thomas from Rosecrans
to take command of the army, which was
left on the field, and to fall back to Rossville, to
form a new line, and to hold back the enemy from
Chattanooga. Thomas made his headquarters
near the Snodgrass house and directed all the
movements of the Union forces for the rest of the
day. He determined to hold the present line at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
least until night, when the retreat could be made
with less danger. To meet the six triumphant
divisions of Longstreet, the available troops in line
were Croxton’s and part only of Connell’s brigades
of Brannan’s division; Wood, with only
Harker’s brigade, and one regiment of Buell’s;
his other regiments seemed to have faded away,
or been cut off in the break. With Wood’s line
were a part of John Beatty’s brigade, a part of
Stanley’s, and the Twenty-first Ohio of Sirwell’s:
these were of Negley’s division, but Negley was
not with them. There were parts of the Ninth
and Seventeenth Kentucky, Forty-fourth Indiana,
and Thirteenth Ohio of Van Cleve’s division,
but no division commander with them.</p>

<p>The Forty-fourth Indiana of Dick’s brigade,
and the Seventeenth Kentucky of Beatty’s brigade,
and both of Van Cleve’s—Barnes’s brigade
being still on the left—were the only regiments
which deflected from the fugitives, and fell in
with Wood’s and Brannan’s line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Page_114a"><img src="images/i137.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Chickamauga, evening of September 20, 1863</span><br />
Adapted from Fiske’s <i>The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War</i>, p. 274</p>

<p>Longstreet’s troops attacked these fragments repeatedly
with tremendous force, but were repulsed
with great loss. Finally one of Hindman’s brigades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
gained a position on Brannan’s right and
rear, without opposition, for no troops were there to
oppose them. Negley had held that point earlier
with ample artillery and infantry supports, but
he was then in Rossville. Just at this time,
when disaster again seemed inevitable, General
Gordon Granger reported to General Thomas;
having marched his troops with the true instincts of
a soldier from McAffee’s church, in front of Rossville
Gap facing Ringgold, to the sound of the
battle. Thomas ordered him to the right of
Brannan. Two large brigades, Whittaker’s and
John G. Mitchell’s, were commanded by the gallant
General James B. Steedman; these formed
in line, charged up the hill against that brigade
which had gained the flank of Croxton, and drove
it pell-mell back down the hill with great slaughter.
At this time, Van Derveer’s brigade came
from the Kelly field, where it had done such fine
service. This brigade formed on Steedman’s
left and joined in the attack. When this combined
force struck the enemy the musketry firing
was heavier than any before delivered. It lasted
perhaps twenty minutes. It was immediately in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the rear of Baird’s division, on the left, about three-fourths
of a mile away; could not be seen on account
of the woods, but was heard, and it was terrific.
Twice Hindman reformed at a safe distance,
and tried to recapture the hill, but being
overwhelmed, abandoned any future efforts;
these brigades formed in prolongation of Brannan’s
right and fought until dark. While Sheridan
was marching on the west side of Missionary
Ridge towards Rossville, Granger was marching
on the east side of it towards the battle, without
other orders than a general one, given days before
to support the army. They both must have
heard the firing, and should have marched to it;
if these fugitive troops could have been brought
on the field with a competent commander, what
would the result have been? How could they
keep away? Would not the Confederate Army—which
was so nearly used up—have been glad
to fall back to Rome?</p>

<p>Hindman, in his report<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> speaks in the following
words of this desperate contest on the Union
right lasting over four hours, viz.: “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
never known Federal troops to fight so well.”
General Daniel H. Hill, who commanded a Confederate
corps on the army’s right, says in an article
on the battle of Chickamauga, that he never
saw the dead so thick anywhere as he did on the
slopes of Snodgrass Hill after the attacks by
Longstreet’s several divisions.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>General Garfield after returning from Rossville
to the field, rode long the lines of his old brigade,
now Harker’s of Wood’s division, cheered the men
with muskets and gave by his presence the evidence
that others who did not come back from
the rear could have done so. Longstreet’s report
states: “Hood’s column broke the enemy’s line
near the Brotherton house, and made it wheel to
the right. In making this movement Major-General
Hood fell severely and it was feared mortally
wounded by a minie ball breaking his
thigh.” Law succeeded Hood in command.
Longstreet continues as follows: “About three
o’clock in the afternoon I asked the commanding
general for some of the troops of the Right Wing,
but was informed by him that they had been beaten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
back so badly that they could be of no service to
me.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The figures of losses on the two wings
given later on will show that Bragg was right.</p>

<p>The forces to resist the whole Confederate
Army were but five divisions in line. The rank
and file of these divisions did not know of the
condition on the right, which was very fortunate;
they stood and fought therefore defensively, and
with great confidence and bravery.</p>

<p>The Union line, as now formed, consisted of
Thomas’s original five divisions and such troops
as Wood’s one brigade (Harker’s), a fraction
of another (Buell’s) and fractions of regiments
which had drifted in, together with Steedman’s
two brigades. It stood off the Confederate Army
until dark. An attack on General Thomas’s left—organized
about three o’clock—must be mentioned,
however. It is supposed that this was made
in order to prevent any of the Union troops at that
point from being sent to the right. The attack
was a general one and was easily repulsed. The
divisions of Breckenridge, Liddell, Armstrong’s
dismounted cavalry, and Forrest’s artillery across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the Lafayette road, were active. Willich made
the fourth charge along the length of Kelly’s field
against these troops across the Lafayette road. At
half after five o’clock all was quiet on the Union
left, and confidence filled the hearts of the troops;
but the attacks by Longstreet on the Union right
lasted another hour.</p>

<p>Thomas had orders from Rosecrans to draw
back to Rossville; Granger wanted him to ignore
the orders and hold the field; but Thomas would
not accede to such a request, and began the movement
at half past five. His line was solid and
confident, but had very little ammunition, and no
rations. He was largely outnumbered and outflanked
at both right and left; by falling back to
Rossville he would gain the fugitive troops, whom
he had been unable to induce to march back to this
position; he would also gain a stronger defensive
line, which would better cover the approaches to
the city. He intended to start the movement so
early in the evening that he could get the troops
in the proper roads and directions before night,
when darkness would protect them from danger
of attack during the march. Boynton says: “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
was in no sense a military retreat,” it was done “because
Chattanooga, and not the Chickamauga
woods, was the objective of the campaign.” Still,
it may also be said, that the Confederate Army
was the objective, and that its destruction was of
more importance than the occupation of the city.
It is quite certain that General Thomas would
gladly have remained on the field, if he had been
confident that he could have destroyed Bragg’s
army the next day. He did not know at that time
that it was badly used up as later events proved
and the movement backwards in the face of a very
vigilant foe, who was constantly advancing in almost
full force, would have been dangerous.</p>

<p>The dispositions made by General George H.
Thomas—before and after he discovered the
break in the Union right—were of the highest
military character; his plan of withdrawal to
Rossville was equally scientific. In his report he
says, that after the arrival of Granger’s forces and
their effective attack on the enemy’s troops on the
right of Brannan, every assault of the enemy until
nightfall was repulsed in the most gallant style by
the whole line. This was the result of his skillful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
placing of troops, his constant watchfulness
with regard to the movements of the enemy, and
the excellent counter movements by the Union
forces. But the real cause of the preservation of
the army was the masterful formation of the five
divisions remaining under General Thomas’s command
on the morning of the 20th; they were
formed in compact, double lines, protected by log
breastworks and had three or four brigades in reserve;
these lines required no re-adjustment and
were not penetrated. His watchfulness of the
troops—of which many formed under his own direction
on Snodgrass Hill after the break on the
right—enabled him to point out instantly where
they should go, when Granger and Steedman appeared.
Let it be remembered that he was at that
time unaware of the extent of the disaster on the
right. In his report he states, “General Garfield,
chief of staff of General Rosecrans, reached this
position about 4 p. m., in company with Lieutenant-Colonel
Thruston, of McCook’s staff, and Captains
Gaw and Barker, of my staff, who had been
sent to the rear to bring back the ammunition, if possible.
General Garfield gave me the first reliable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
information that the right and centre of our army
had been driven, and of its condition at that time. I
soon after received a dispatch from General Rosecrans,
directing me to assume command of all the
forces, and, with Crittenden and McCook, take a
strong position, and assume a threatening attitude
at Rossville, sending the unorganized forces to
Chattanooga for reorganization, stating that he
would examine the ground at Chattanooga, and
then join me; also that he had sent out rations and
ammunition to me at Rossville.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>General Thomas, of course, knew before Garfield
reached him that disaster of some kind had
occurred on the right; but he did not know its extent,
neither did he know of the departure of the
many troops and high officers from the field.
When he received this dispatch from General
Rosecrans he determined to fall back and immediately
formulated his plans. To enable the
troops in line to hold the positions they occupied
until the proper time to fall back, he sent two aides
to distribute some ammunition—ten rounds to the
man—which Granger had brought with him. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
soon as this was done he sent Captain Willard, an
aide, to direct the division commanders to be prepared
to withdraw their commands as soon as they
received orders. At 5:30 p. m. Captain Barker
carried the order to Reynolds to commence the
movement. Thomas does not indicate in his report
why he wanted Reynolds to commence the
movement, but it has been shown that his division
was the one best located for the work. A brigade
of Confederate troops of Liddell’s division occupied
at that time the woods on the west of the Lafayette
road, between the Union right on Snodgrass
Hill and the left around the Kelly field.
It was in the rear of both Union wings. Reynolds’s
position was at the head of these woods,
and his troops could fire into the Confederate
lines without danger to the backs of the Union
soldiers. Under Thomas’s direction, Turchin’s
brigade moved down the Lafayette road, and
filed to the left; when his rear had cleared the
road and faced to the right on the march, he threw
his brigade upon the Confederate forces and drove
them in utter defeat entirely beyond Baird’s left.
This was the fifth charge made during the day in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the same direction along this road, in and adjacent
to the Kelly field. General Thomas posted Reynolds’s
two brigades, Turchin’s and Robinson’s—formerly
King’s—together with Johnson’s reserve
brigade and General Willich’s on the ridge road
west of the Lafayette road, near the Mullis farm,
in order to cover McFarland’s Gap. Thomas’s report
describes best what followed: “These dispositions
being made, I sent orders to Generals
Wood, Brannan, and Granger to withdraw from
their positions. Johnson’s and Baird’s division
were attacked at the moment of retiring, but, by being
prepared, retired without confusion or any serious
losses. General Palmer was attacked while
retiring. * * * I then proceeded to Rossville,
accompanied by Generals Garfield and Gordon
Granger, and immediately prepared to place the
troops in position at that point.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>During Baird’s withdrawal he was heavily attacked
by the enemy, and lost a great many who
were taken prisoners; some of these remained
too long behind the breastworks, others took a
wrong direction in falling back. The troops which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
had retreated to Rossville Gap during the day
were reorganized by their officers prior to the falling
back of the main army. Negley’s division
was placed directly across the gap, and the next
morning Baird’s was placed behind it; the other
divisions on the right and left (on the crest of
the ridge) were stationed with Minty’s cavalry
in front of the gap, about one mile and a half on
the Ringgold road. General R. B. Mitchell’s
cavalry was on the Union right covering McFarland’s
Gap, and extending his right to the Chattanooga
Creek. McCook’s Corps was in line
about a mile behind him.</p>

<p>On September 21, General N. B. Forrest advanced
at Rossville some Confederate cavalry close
enough to throw a shell or two into a Union
wagon train and Minty’s advance Union cavalry
on the Ringgold road had a little skirmish. But
the Confederate Army was not advancing; apparently
it did not intend to attack the position at
this point. In fact, General Bragg did not know
of the retirement of the Union Army until the 21st,
and he did not order an advance. The Confederate
Army lay still on the field during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
21st, and most of the 22nd. Therefore General
Thomas advised General Rosecrans to concentrate
the troops at Chattanooga, and this was done
on the night of September 21, in a most admirable
manner under Thomas’s direction. Brannan’s
division—in order to cover and protect the movement—was
posted half way between Rossville
and Chattanooga. Nearly all the infantry and
artillery were in or around the city by 7 a. m. of
the 22nd. The different organizations were
marched directly to positions previously assigned
them.</p>

<p>Baird’s division (now Rousseau’s), with Minty’s
cavalry still in rear of it, brought up the
rear, and did not arrive in the entrenchments
around the city until late in the evening of the
22nd. General Rousseau, who was absent from
early in August, joined the army again at Rossville
on September 21, and assumed command of his
old division. General Baird was later assigned
to another division at Chattanooga.</p>

<p>In the forenoon of the 22nd, Cheatham’s Confederate
division marched to the neighborhood of
Chickamauga station, and took a road leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
thence to the top of Missionary Ridge; it was followed
by the rest of Polk’s Corps on the 23rd. On
the same day, Hill’s and Longstreet’s corps followed
on different roads and slowly formed their
line on top of the ridge. Longstreet’s and Hill’s
was thrown across the valley to the foot of Lookout;
their left was on the top of Lookout Mountain
and their right on the northeast nose of Missionary
Ridge, abutting on the Tennessee River,
but the main line did not reach to the river. Their
camps were principally located in the Chickamauga
Valley on the east side of the ridge, where
they were protected from observation by the Union
forces.</p>

<h3>WISCONSIN TROOPS AT CHICKAMAUGA</h3>

<p>There were five infantry regiments from Wisconsin
in the battle of Chickamauga, viz.:
the First, Tenth, Fifteenth, Twenty-first, and
Twenty-fourth. The First and Twenty-first
were parts of the Second Brigade, commanded by
General John C. Starkweather—formerly Colonel
of the First Wisconsin Infantry—of the First Division,
commanded by General Absalom Baird, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
the Fourteenth Corps, commanded by General
George H. Thomas. They were actively engaged
near the extreme left on both days of the
battle. When Baird’s division on the morning of
the 19th advanced from Kelly’s house on the Lafayette
road, Starkweather’s brigade was in reserve
behind the other two brigades of the division.
His brigade was formed in two lines, the
first composed of the First Wisconsin on the right
and the Seventy-ninth Pennsylvania on the left,
with the Fourth Indiana Battery between the two
wings. The Twenty-first Wisconsin Infantry
and Twenty-fourth Illinois Infantry formed the
rear line. Lieutenant-Colonel George B. Bingham
commanded the First, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Harrison C. Hobart the Twenty-first. Having
advanced about a mile through the woods, driving
the enemy’s skirmishers, Starkweather moved
to Thomas’s left by the order of the General, in
order to relieve Croxton’s brigade of Brannan’s
division, reported to be out of ammunition. General
Starkweather seems to have no sooner taken
position here than the enemy attacked in such
overwhelming numbers as to force him back. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
retreated to a ridge in the rear of his left; leaving
his battery temporarily in the possession of the enemy.
Very soon the enemy was struck on his
flank and rear by General Johnson’s division of
McCook’s Corps and forced back; the battery was
then recovered.</p>

<p>In reforming the lines late in the afternoon,
Starkweather’s brigade was placed on the left of
Johnson’s division; it took part in the night attack
by the Confederate General Cleburne, and was
under fire during the whole of the battle of the
19th. On the morning of the 20th it formed the
right of Baird’s position in the woods east of the
Kelly field, and was in one of the most exposed
positions; this brought it again on the left of Johnson’s
division. The Fourth Indiana Battery had
two guns in the centre of the brigade and two
upon the left. General Starkweather in his official
report says: “This position was held and
retained during the whole day under repeated attacks
from the enemy in heavy columns supported
with batteries, repulsing and driving the enemy
back from time to time; driving the enemy also
back from the extreme left with the artillery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
* * * While holding this position the ammunition
of my first line was expended, and most of
the second line, together with all the ammunition
of the battery, except three rounds of canister.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
He retired with the rest of Baird’s division in the
evening of the 20th to Rossville, thence to Chattanooga
on the 22nd. In the retirement, Lieutenant-Colonel
Hobart, eight other commissioned officers,
and 67 men of the Twenty-first Wisconsin
were captured by the enemy. The loss of the
First Wisconsin was 188 killed, wounded, and
missing; the latter being 77. The officers killed
were Captains Abner O. Heald, and William S.
Mitchell; Lieutenants James S. Richardson, and
Charles A. Searles. Of the Twenty-first the
loss was 121, of these 76 were missing. The
First seems to have gone into the battle with 391,
and the Twenty-first with 369 men.</p>

<p>The Tenth Wisconsin Infantry—commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel John H. Ely—was in
Scribner’s brigade of Baird’s division. The history
of its fighting is almost identical with that of
the First and Twenty-first. On the 20th the Tenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
Wisconsin Infantry was immediately on the left
of Starkweather. Colonel Ely, Major McKercher
and several other officers, together with a
large number of men were captured in falling
back (by orders), on the evening of the 20th.
They, by mistake, took the wrong direction, going
too far to the right, as they faced the rear, and
thus ran into the enemy. Its loss was a total
of 211, but 145 of these were missing. Captain
J. W. Roby, who made the report says: “Monday
morning September 21st we numbered three
officers and 26 men.” Lieutenant-Colonel Ely’s
name appears among those killed; the other officers
killed were Captain George M. West and
Lieutenant Robert Rennie.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth Wisconsin Infantry served in the
Third brigade, Davis’s division of the Twentieth
Corps. This brigade was commanded by Colonel
Hans C. Heg until he was killed on the 19th;
and afterwards by Colonel John A. Martin.
This regiment fought most gallantly with Davis’s
division on the 19th, when, according to their official
report, the loss was 7 officers and 59 enlisted
men killed, wounded, and missing. It will be remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
that on the 20th General Davis’s division
was cut off on the right by the break at Wood’s
division, and that it, after some desultory fighting,
retired to McFarland’s Gap. The total loss of
the Fifteenth Wisconsin Infantry was 111, of
which 55 men were captured or missing. The
officers killed were Colonel Hans C. Heg, Captains
Hans Hanson, Henry Hauff, John M.
Johnson, and Lieutenant Oliver Thompson.</p>

<p>The Twenty-fourth Wisconsin Infantry was
in General Lytle’s brigade of the First Division
of the Twentieth Corps. This regiment, with
the brigade to which it was attached, occupied the
entrenchments at Lee and Gordon’s Mill on the
afternoon of the 19th, where it relieved General
Thomas J. Wood’s division; it remained here all
afternoon under a little artillery fire from the
enemy, which did no harm, however. At 3 a. m.
on the 20th it went to a point near General Rosecrans’s
headquarters, near the Widow Glenn’s
house; at 10:30 a. m. it double quicked—under a
terrific fire from the enemy—to the point where
General Lytle was killed; it fought here for thirty
minutes driving the enemy, but was soon outflanked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
by Hindman’s troops coming toward its
left flank from the celebrated break. The official
report of its commander (Major Carl Von
Baumbach), from which the foregoing facts are
gleaned, says further: “We retreated in some
disorder; but quickly reformed on a hill some 400
yards to the rear. Our brave and gallant commander,
Lieutenant-Colonel T. S. West, being
among the missing, I assumed command.” This
regiment bivouaced for the night at Rossville; its
loss was 3 officers and 69 men killed and
wounded, and 20 missing; Captain Gustavus
Goldsmith was killed. The Major in his report
makes especial mention of Lieutenant Thomas E.
Balding, acting adjutant, for his gallant conduct.</p>

<p>The First Wisconsin Cavalry—under command
of Colonel Oscar H. LaGrange—was a
part of the Second Brigade, of Colonel Edward
M. McCook’s cavalry division. During the campaign,
preceding the battle, this regiment performed
the usual duties of cavalry in reconnoitering,
picketing, leading in advance of the marching
column of infantry, and generally acting with the
rest of the cavalry, as the eyes of the army. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the 19th it was stationed on the right of the army
to watch the enemy’s cavalry, which kept on the
east side of the Chickamauga in the movement
back to Rossville, and thence into Chattanooga, it
protected the trains and rear of the army. Its loss
was 2 men wounded and 4 missing.</p>

<p>There were three Wisconsin light batteries
with the Army of the Cumberland, in the battle
of Chickamauga: the Third, Fifth, and Eighth.
The Third Battery—commanded by Lieutenant
Courtland Livingston—was attached to Van
Cleve’s division of Crittenden’s Corps. Captain
L. H. Drury of this battery, was chief of artillery
of the division; he was severely wounded in a skirmish
several days before the battle. This battery
followed the fortunes of its division; but there
seems to be no definite report by its commanding
officer. Its losses were 2 killed, 12 wounded
and 12 missing, out of an aggregate of 119.</p>

<p>The Fifth Wisconsin Battery, commanded by
Captain George Q. Gardner was attached to the
First Brigade, commanded by Colonel P. Sidney
Post of General Jefferson C. Davis’s division
of the Twentieth Corps. This brigade was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
guarding the supply train, and was not engaged
in the battle, and this battery had no losses. The
brigade commander, in his official report, commends
Captain Gardner for great zeal and ability
in the management of the battery.</p>

<p>The Eighth Wisconsin Battery—commanded
by Lieutenant John D. McLean—was attached
to Colonel Heg’s brigade of Davis’s division of
McCook’s Twentieth Corps. The chief of artillery
of Davis’s division reports, that the movement
of the artillery in the Chickamauga woods was not
deemed practicable; therefore, this battery did
not become engaged, and had no losses.</p>

<p>The Chickamauga campaign proper was now
ended. It formed the second step in the campaign
from Murfreesboro to Chattanooga; the
Tullahoma campaign being the first. It is true,
the city was now occupied by the Army of the
Cumberland, but its possession was not secure as
long as the Confederate Army lay within two or
three miles, and held the city’s most available lines
of supply by the river and the river road, between
Bridgeport and Chattanooga. Therefore, another
conflict was necessary, which would constitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
the third step in the great campaign. An account
of that struggle will include the coming of
reinforcements to the Union Army; the opening of
what the men in the ranks called, “the cracker
line;” the reorganization of the Army of the
Cumberland; and an account of the four battles of
Wauhatchie, Orchard Knob, Lookout Mountain,
and Missionary Ridge. But before that is attempted,
it will be necessary to make some observations
on the late battle of Chickamauga.</p>

<p>The Army of the Cumberland—or rather that
part of it which now occupied the city—was reduced
by the Chickamauga battle to an estimated
aggregate of 35,000. This estimate excluded
perhaps the cavalry. Its total losses, killed,
wounded, and prisoners, in the Chickamauga campaign
reached 13,615. A large number of sick,
besides the wounded, were in hospitals. But the
Confederate losses were at least 5,374 more than
those of the Union Army. General Longstreet,
in his book, <i>From Manassas to Appomatox</i>,
claims that the Confederate force at Chickamauga
was somewhat less than 60,000 men. The Confederate
records are so defective that it is largely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
an estimate to give their numbers or losses. General
H. V. Boynton estimates the number at
very much more than 60,000. There is no doubt
that Bragg actually outnumbered Rosecrans on the
field by several thousand troops, perhaps in the
proportion of 60,000 to 50,000.</p>

<p>The Union Army captured 2,003 prisoners,
and lost 4,774. Of the latter 2,500 were
wounded and left on the field when the army fell
back to Rossville. The terrible fighting which
took place is shown by the number of killed and
wounded on each side. Longstreet says in his
book, that Bragg’s killed and wounded amounted
to 16,986, but the official returns make them about
1,100 less, or 15,881. The official returns of the
army give the Union losses of killed and wounded
11,338. The Confederate loss was greater in
killed and wounded than at Gettysburg; and the
largest the enemy had in a single battle. Attention
is called to the fact, that the numbers engaged
at Gettysburg were about 80,000 on each side;
and that the battle lasted three days.</p>

<p>The killed and wounded in some battles of the
war are shown in the following table:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<p>In every one of these battles the Union loss was
greater than the Confederate, except at Chickamauga;
yet Shiloh, Gettysburg, and Stone’s River
are recorded as Union victories. The Confederate
loss at Antietam was much smaller than that
given above, which includes Harper’s Ferry, South
Mountain, Crampton’s Gap, and Shepardstown.
The prisoners captured are excluded from the
above list, because only the killed and wounded
indicate the intensity of the fighting.</p>

<p>The Confederate’s large losses at Chickamauga
show plainly the active musketry of the Union
troops, their good marksmanship, and the difference
(in the number of casualties) between making
and receiving attacks. On the second day the
Union troops remained in line and received the attacks
of the Confederates. At Gettysburg the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Union forces did the same thing during the last
two days. Those on the left at Chickamauga
were protected by breastworks, and suffered
but little loss on the 20th; while they inflicted very
heavy punishment on the Confederates; for instance,
Hill’s Corps of the Confederate right lost
2,990 out of 8,894; Jackson’s brigade of Cheatham’s
division lost 35 per cent. of his force, and the
losses in Govan’s brigade exceeded 50 per cent.
On the Union side Steedman, while attacking the
Confederate troops—which had gained an enfilading
position and were about to attack the right
flank of Brannan—lost in this assault and in the
subsequent position which his troops occupied,
1,787 out of 3,700 in about four hours. The loss
is fearful, when assaults are made on protected
lines, or on points held with difficult approaches.
On the Confederate left Benning’s brigade of
Hood’s division lost 56.6 per cent.; Gregg’s brigade
of B. R. Johnson’s lost 44.4 per cent. Taking
Longstreet’s estimate of 16,986 killed and wounded,
and adding to it the number of prisoners captured,
namely, 2,003, the total Confederate loss
aggregates 18,989. It is officially established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
that the Union loss was 11,338 in killed and
wounded; its loss in prisoners was 4,774; but 2,500
of them were wounded and were left on the
battlefield. It is reasonable to suppose that these
wounded left on the field were reported as wounded
by their company officers, and are included in
the official returns of the 11,338.</p>

<p>The historian will point out sharply the immense
benefit to the Union Army derived from
the log works and the compact lines of the four
divisions under General Thomas on the 20th. The
conclusion is a fair one, that the whole line ought
to have been similarly fortified; there was ample
supply of timber along the line to provide for such
protection. Of the five divisions under General
Thomas’s command on the 19th and on the 20th,
Brannan’s was the only one which fought both days
without works; on the 19th none of them fought
behind any entrenchments, yet they fought against
six Confederate divisions, viz.: two of Walker’s
corps, two of Cheatham’s, Cleburne’s, and Stewart’s.
On the 20th Brannan was on the right and
did not fight any of the Confederate troops, which
Baird’s, Johnson’s, Palmer’s, Reynolds’s, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
own divisions had fought on the 19th. Van Derveer’s
brigade of Brannan’s division made one
charge, however, along the Kelly field, against
two brigades of Breckenridge’s; then returned to
the right. But it must be noticed that Breckenridge
was not in the fight of the 19th. On the 20th
Baird, Johnson, Palmer, and Reynolds fought behind
breastworks all day the same divisions they
had fought the day before without breastworks,
and also Breckenridge’s in addition. It is true
they were assisted a little by two brigades of Negley’s
and one of Van Cleve’s on the left of the
breastworks. In addition to the Confederate infantry
divisions mentioned, there was also Forrest’s
cavalry of 3,500, which would more than offset
any assistance these four Union divisions had received
from other troops on the 20th. The following
table will show the losses in killed and
wounded of the divisions on both sides, with the
exception of prisoners captured during the two
days of battle in and around the Kelly field.</p>

<p>There were 14 Union brigades and 19 Confederate.
It will be seen that Brannan, who was not
protected by works on the 20th, lost about 800
more than the highest loss of any of the Union divisions,
which were protected. That is a practical
illustration of the value of the precautions thus
taken by the protected troops. Estimating Brannan’s
loss on the 20th at 900, his loss on the 19th
would be 1,077. This would reduce the total
loss in the Union column above to 5,083. Considering
that the Confederate divisions mentioned
above encountered no other Union troops during
the battle, except those five divisions mentioned,
it will be understood that the five Union divisions
by incurring a loss of 5,083 killed and wounded,
inflicted a loss on the enemy of 8,625. Forrest’s
loss does not appear but should be added to the latter;
let this item be offset, however, by the losses to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Beatty’s Stanley’s and Barnes’s brigades in their
assistance on the left of Baird.</p>

<p>We will make a similar comparison of the losses
on the right of the Union, and the left of the Confederate
Army:</p>

<p>The estimated Confederate loss given above has
been made up in the following manner. The official
Confederate loss is given by Colonel W. F.
Fox in his <i>Regimental Losses in the Civil War</i>
as 15,881 killed and wounded at Chickamauga,
the Confederate loss of the troops opposed to the
above named Union divisions can be found by
adding to 8,625—the Confederate losses in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
first table given above—the estimated loss of the
Confederate cavalry, probably enough to bring the
figures to 9,000, and deducting that from 15,881,
the total Confederate loss is secured. The result
makes 6, 881 killed and wounded—as given in the
last table—by the seven Union divisions mentioned
above, at a cost to the latter of 6,140 killed and
wounded. Longstreet gives in his report his loss
at 7,594 killed and wounded; deducting Stewart’s
loss from this sum leaves 5,920 as the loss of the
above mentioned Confederate forces. This
makes the contrast between the two tables still
greater.</p>

<p>These figures emphasize the deadly fighting in
that great battle, and they are more eloquent of the
valor of American soldiers than words of song or
oratory. They emphasize also the value of defensive
breastworks, in comparison with fighting
unprotected.</p>

<p>The Union troops expended 2,650,000 musket
cartridges in hitting the 15,881 Confederate killed
and wounded; some of them were, however,
wounded by artillery. It appears as if it took
about 150 infantry cartridges to hit one man. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
expenditure was 650,000 more cartridges than at
Stone’s River; but then 6,642 more of the Confederates
were struck at Chickamauga, which shows
that the firing was much more destructive.</p>

<p>General Rosecrans states:<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> “The fight on the
left after 2 p. m., was that of the army. Never,
in the history of this war at least have troops fought
with greater energy and determination. Bayonet
charges, often heard of but seldom seen, were
repeatedly made by brigades and regiments in several
of our divisions.”</p>

<p>At 2 p. m. on September 21, C. A. Dana, Assistant
Secretary of War, sent a dispatch from
Chattanooga to the Secretary of War. It contained
the following statements: “Thomas, finding
himself cut off from Rosecrans and the right,
at once brought his seven divisions into position for
independent fighting. Refusing both his right
and left, his line assumed the form of a horse-shoe
posted along the slope and crest of a partly wooded
ridge. He was soon joined by Granger from
Rossville, with the brigade of McCook and division
of Steedman, and with these forces firmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
maintained the fight till after dark. Our troops
were as immovable as the rocks they stood on. The
enemy hurled against them repeatedly the dense
columns which had routed Davis and Sheridan in
the morning, but every onset was repulsed with
dreadful slaughter. Falling first on one and then
another point of our lines, for hours the rebels
vainly sought to break them. Thomas seemed
to have filled every soldier with his own unconquerable
firmness, and Granger, his hat torn by bullets,
raged like a lion wherever the contest was hottest
with the electrical courage of a Ney. * * *
When night fell this body of heroes stood on the
same ground they had occupied in the morning
their spirit unbroken, but their numbers greatly
diminished. * * * The divisions of Wood,
Johnson, Brannan, Palmer, Reynolds, and Baird,
which never broke at all, have lost very
severely.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He should have added that they inflicted
greater loss upon the enemy than any of the
other divisions. The discouraged spirit of the
Confederate Army at the close of the battle was
sufficiently apparent when the forces under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Thomas’s command were able—after the arrival
of General Gordon Granger’s troops—to stop the
enemy’s further successes. It is evident that the
fighting spirit was gone from Bragg’s army since,
although they discovered the falling back, they did
not approach Rossville Gap on the 21st with a
considerable force, nor seriously interfere in the
backward movement to Chattanooga, not even trying
to capture a wagon, mule, or horse, although
its great cavalry leader, Forrest and his troopers,
were in force close to Rossville Gap. It was
more paralyzed than the Union Army. General
Daniel H. Hill, who commanded a Confederate
corps on the right in the battle, states in the
article referred to before: “There was no more
splendid fighting in ’61, when the flower of the
Southern youth was in the field, than was displayed
in those bloody days of September, ’63.
But it seems to me that the <i>elan</i> of the Southern soldier
was never seen after Chickamauga—that brilliant
dash which had distinguished him was gone
forever. He was too intelligent not to know
that the cutting in two of Georgia meant death to
all his hopes. * * * He fought stoutly to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
last, but, after Chickamauga, with the sullenness of
despair and without the enthusiasm of hope. That
‘barren’ victory sealed the fate of the Southern
Confederacy.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>If the Army of the Cumberland accomplished
so much at Chickamauga in spite of certain mistakes,
after having penetrated to the centre of the
Confederate territory, what might not have been
done, if the right of the Union line had been properly
placed and protected during the night of the
19th, and if the disastrous order to Wood had not
been issued? The withdrawal of Wood from
the line—just before Bushrod Johnson advanced
against the centre—cost the Union fighting line
10,000 men, and caused the withdrawal, some
hours later, of the Union Army to Rossville.
Whether Wood interpreted that order correctly,
the fact is that the order should never have been issued.
The movement of closing in towards the left
and of throwing the right further back, should have
been done hours before. One of Mitchell’s cavalry
divisions should have been placed on the Union
left during the night of the 19th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>It must be conceded that Brannan’s division was
the most active in the battle. It was well managed,
but its loss in killed and wounded was
greater than that of any other Union division.
Brannan lost in killed and wounded 1,977,
with 214 missing. His division fought bravely
under his skillful management, yet he was unprotected
on both days. Negley’s loss was 496
killed and wounded, the smallest loss of all. The
following officers went through the battle with
great credit, viz.: Generals Thomas, Granger,
Steedman, Brannan, Baird, Johnson, Palmer,
Reynolds; and Brigade-Commanders Hazen,
Harker, Van Derveer, Croxton, Whittaker, John
C. Mitchell, Willich, and Turchin.</p>

<p>If a real soldier, like Longstreet, had been in
command of the Confederate right and had found
upon advancing against the Union line, that two
brigades lengths extended beyond the Union left,
he would certainly have made more out of such a
condition than did Breckenridge or Leonidas Polk.</p>

<p>General D. H. Hill, in his report<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> discusses the
situation as follows: “The important results effected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
by two brigades on the flank proved that,
had our army been moved under cover of the
woods a mile farther to the right, the whole Yankee
position would have been turned and an almost
bloodless victory gained. A simple reconnoisance
before the battle would have shown the
practicability of the movement and the advantage
to be gained by it.” Hill was in command on that
flank and should have acted in accordance with his
understanding of the situation, or at least reported
the facts to his superior. This was what Rosecrans
was anxious about when he hastened troops
from the right to the left. If Sheridan could have
reached Thomas before Longstreet cut him off in
the act of double-quicking toward the left flank,
what would have happened?</p>

<p>General Thomas’s dispositions to protect his left
showed military genius of the highest order, and
General Baird greatly assisted him in this matter.
This was only one instance, however, of General
Thomas’s many equally meritorious tactics in this
great battle. He rose to the highest point in the
estimation of both officers and men.</p>

<p>Both days’ fighting illustrates the fact that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
troops are outflanked or attacked in the rear, however
brave they may be in other positions relative
to the enemy, they will as a rule go to pieces. It
was repeatedly shown on both sides, especially on
the 19th, during the battle, that the veteran troops
as well as the new regiments, would become disheartened
and confused in such a position; many
of the regiments on the left during the second day,
who did not flinch when attacked in flank and rear
on the day before, then went to pieces.</p>

<p>The protected troops on the Union left fought
through the entire day of the 20th, entirely unconscious
that they were frequently surrounded not
only in front and rear of their own line, but that the
two flanks of the army were only about three-fourths
of a mile apart, although in the morning
they were two and a half miles apart. At noon
the Union right was contracted, and thrown back
against the left. The order to retreat late in
evening of the 20th came as a surprise and shock to
these troops, who had been repulsing the enemy all
day with comparative ease. Thousands of musket
bearers were so stiff and sore from the two
days’ conflict and the marches over the mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
during the preceding days, that when a regiment
lying down on the evening of the 20th attempted
to rise there was a distinct creaking of bones and an
accompanying groan, slight, but perceptible.
Many of them while moving back to Rossville at
night, took the desperate chance of lying down for
a nap in the woods by the roadside, intending
to rest for an hour or two and then join their regiments
again before daylight; but hundreds of these
awoke to find it was already daylight and many
were captured by the enemy’s cavalry.</p>

<p>The Confederate Army itself did not advance
from the battlefield until the 23rd; only a small
part leaving on the 22nd. The fact is that the
Confederate Army was much more used up than
the Union Army; General Bragg said to General
Longstreet on the 20th that his troops upon his right
were used up.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The same Confederate troops
which had penetrated the line and driven Davis,
Sheridan, and others from the field, were so roughly
handled by Brannan and Granger on Snodgrass
Hill that they could not be brought forward
for another attack. The slowness with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
which the Confederate Army moved to their positions
around Chattanooga proves that they were
practically defeated. At the time the orders were
sent to the divisions behind the log works on the
left to prepare for withdrawal, their commanders
sent word back to General Thomas that there was
no reason for them to retreat; they had been,
and were at that moment repulsing easily every assault.
They did not know of the disaster to the
right, caused by Wood’s withdrawal, nor did
General Baird and his brigade commanders know
of the movements of either Union or Confederate
forces until after the retreat. Many writers have
expressed the opinion that the Union Army should
not have retreated. But to a soldier who was
present on the field and knew the facts—such
as the absence of the commander of the army; his
order sent from the far rear to fall back to Rossville;
the absence of ammunition and rations; the
utterly exhausted condition of the rank and file by
the superhuman exertions of the two days’ fighting
and the preceding hard marching; the fear that if
the Union Army remained, the Confederate Army
might yet wedge its way between it and Chattanooga,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
the Union commander not being aware
at that time of the exhausted and discouraged condition
of the Confederate Army—it seems that the
falling back in the way and at the time it did was
the correct thing. At least it seems as if Thomas
had really nothing else to do than to fall back
when the order from General Rosecrans was received.
Had General Thomas been the commander
of the army, it might have been different.</p>

<p>The Union cavalry did not properly cooperate
with the other arms of the Union forces. Forrest,
with his large Confederate cavalry force, was close
to the right of the Confederate Army, and did
fine service; the force was equal to the infantry
in number. Forrest should have been opposed by
a division of the Union cavalry. Only one cavalry
brigade was needed at Crawfish Springs;
the other cavalry brigade together with Wilder’s
mounted infantry which closed up on the right of
McCook, should have given better service at a time
when it was most needed. This was not the fault
of the cavalry commander, for he only obeyed
orders from his superiors. In a dispatch to General
R. B. Mitchell, the commander of the cavalry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
at 7:15 p. m. September 20, General Rosecrans
said, “Had you been on our right today you
could have charged the enemy’s flank, and done
much incalculable mischief.” Why was not his
cavalry as close to the Union right flank as Forrest’s
was to the Confederate right flank? Mitchell’s
cavalry was too far away to be effective,
when disaster overtook the wing: it was supposed
to be protecting, but it was farther away from
Snodgrass Hill on the right than were the forces
of Gordon Granger, at McAffee’s church on the
left.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<i>The Occupation and Battles of Chattanooga</i></h2>
</div>

<p>When the Army of the Cumberland fell back
from Chickamauga and Rossville to Chattanooga,
the first and most important thing to do was to
quickly fortify against attack. The troops marched
directly to the places assigned them, and when all
were in place, the lines half encircled the city,
both flanks terminating at the river. McCook was
on the right, Thomas next, and Crittenden on the
left. The troops began at once the work of throwing
up the ordinary entrenchments; these were from
time to time strengthened until satisfactory. Two
forts had been partially completed by the enemy;
these were finished and occupied by both artillery
and infantry. The army was drawn in close
around the city; the point of Lookout Mountain
and its slopes beyond Chattanooga Creek were
left to the enemy. This gave the Confederate
Army command of the river, the rail and wagon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
roads (parallel with the river), between Chattanooga,
Bridgeport, and Stevenson. The only
other practicable road to the bases of supplies was
over Walden’s Ridge on the north side of the
river, a distance of 60 miles by wagon; thus it became
very difficult to furnish more than half or
three-quarters rations to the men, and only very little
forage could be furnished to the animals. The
road mentioned was so steep and bad that a team
of four or six mules would consume almost the entire
load of feed in bringing the load and in returning
for another.</p>

<p>General Bragg deemed the occupancy of his
main line along Missionary Ridge—across the valley
to Lookout Mountain, thence on the south side
of the river by small detachments at different
points—to Bridgeport sufficient to starve out the
army in Chattanooga. Meanwhile he sent
Wheeler’s cavalry to the north side, in order to
raid the line of supplies. Wheeler burned 300
wagons in the Sequatchie Valley and went on
north doing what damage he could. Fearing
that Bragg might follow Longstreet’s advice and
cross the river east of Chattanooga with a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
part of his army, Rosecrans soon completed an inside
works of circumvallation by which ten thousand
men might be able to hold the city, while he
might be obliged to protect his base of supplies
by marching the rest of his army to meet such a
situation. That Bragg did not undertake an enterprise
of this character was further proof of the used-up
condition of his army, the result of the late battle
of Chickamauga. Bragg’s reasoning regarding
his ability to starve the forces in the city was good
only on the supposition that the Government at
Washington would fail to send sufficient reinforcements
to protect the rear, and to raise “The Siege
of Chattanooga;” it was not more than a semi-siege,
however, and has been so called by some
authors. If Bragg’s army had occupied both
sides of the river and practically surrounded the
city, as the German troops surrounded Paris in the
Franco-German War of 1871, then it could have
been called a siege. Of course the situation of
the Union Army was critical, not only here in
the fortified city, but ever since it crossed the
Tennessee River during the campaign preceding
the battle of Chickamauga. As before mentioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
General Rosecrans estimated on September
23, 1863, that he had about 35,000 troops
in the entrenchments; the cavalry and Wilder’s
brigade of mounted infantry were then on the
north side of the river and guarded the crossings
for a considerable distance, both above and
below. Union reinforcements had been ordered
both from the east and from the west; but Burnside,
who commanded in East Tennessee, was
asking at the same time for help at Knoxville,
instead of being able to send any succor to Rosecrans.
Before the battle of Chickamauga reinforcements
had been ordered from the Army
of the Tennessee—at that time on or near the
Mississippi at Memphis—and from Burnside,
but none had arrived. After the great battle and
the falling back of Rosecrans, the commander did
not need to urge the President and Secretary of
War to be convinced, that unless they really desired
to lose Tennessee and all that had so far been
gained in the department of the Cumberland, other
troops must be sent with the greatest celerity.
Two corps from the Army of the Potomac were
ordered to the battlefield; the Eleventh commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
by General O. O. Howard, and the
Twelfth under General H. W. Slocum; both under
the command of General Joseph Hooker.
General W. T. Sherman was also to reinforce the
Union Army with the Fifteenth Corps, and one
division of the Seventeenth from the Army of the
Tennessee. In the meantime every exertion was
made by the troops present to hold the city at all
hazards. When Wheeler captured and burned
the 300 wagons near Anderson’s cross roads, in the
Sequatchie Valley, Colonel E. M. McCook with
the First Wisconsin Cavalry, the Second and
Fourth Indiana cavalry and a section of artillery
started from Bridgeport up the Sequatchie Valley.
Retarded by an incessant rain, he was in time to
see the smoke only of the burning wagons; he made
a charge and drove a detachment of the enemy’s
troops past the fire upon their main body. He followed
this Confederate division—which was commanded
vigorously by Martin and Wheeler—out
of the valley, captured a number of soldiers and
800 mules and saved some of the wagons.
Wheeler reached McMinnville in time to capture
the garrison and burn the supplies. He was off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
toward Murfreesboro before the arrival of Crook
and his command, who had taken up the pursuit.
The Union cavalry corps, commanded by R. B.
Mitchell, with McCook’s division, joined Crook
at Murfreesboro and saved that place from capture.
They followed Wheeler so persistently
and fought him so successfully that they prevented
the destruction of the railroad, but were unable to
save the telegraph lines. Wheeler crossed back at
Rogersville to the south of the Tennessee; Mitchell
followed and captured at that point a large
amount of Confederate cotton and destroyed it.
Mitchell prevented the Confederate advance to
Winchester and Decherd after having heard at
Huntsville, Alabama, that Roddey’s Confederate
cavalry was moving towards these cities, having
been forced to recross the river. Bragg’s intention
was to destroy Rosecrans’s communications
and to force him to abandon Chattanooga. The
maintenance of the railroad back to Nashville
was of vital importance to the Union Army.
Wheeler’s loss on this raid was according to
the estimate of General Crook, 2,000 men and 6
pieces of artillery. These fatalities made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
Confederate commander more cautious. Crook’s
loss was only 14 killed and 97 wounded.
Wheeler’s raid and the Union pursuit, are specimens
of the kind of warfare which cavalry are
expected to make, showing the terrible destruction
of men and horses, the untiring marches, and
watchfulness necessary in a field so extensive and
difficult as that of the department of Cumberland.
It would have been much more economical and
effective, if the War Department had previously
protected the railway with sufficient infantry, as it
now intended to do, than to protect it by an ordinary
force of cavalry. The Department did
adopt the plan of protecting the railway with infantry,
when Hooker came with a division; this
mode was most effectively used also in 1864.</p>

<p>Although the railroad from Nashville to Stevenson
was being maintained and supplies were accumulated
at the latter city, yet the necessity of
hauling supplies by wagons over such an extended
and precipitous road as the one over Walden’s
Ridge, and the destruction of so many wagons by
Wheeler, told heavily on the devoted troops in the
entrenched city. The rains were heavy and continuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
during the early part of October, making
the roads almost impassable in some places. The
trips to Bridgeport seemed gradually to lengthen,
the mules became thinner, and so the rations had to
be reduced from time to time, until men, horses,
and mules were in very sore straits. The artillery
horses and all extra horses of mounted officers,
that had not already died from starvation, were
sent back to Bridgeport or Stevenson to be kept
there until the strain could be relieved sometime
in the indefinite future. Yet no thought of retreat
or surrender entered the minds of the devoted
soldiers. The fact that the army in the surrounding
hills was in a worse condition—too weak to
take any advantage of the situation by aggressive
movements, except those abortive cavalry raids in
the rear—undoubtedly saved the Union Army
from destruction.</p>

<p>In the early part of October, General Hooker
arrived at Nashville with the Eleventh and
Twelfth corps. They were stationed along the
railroad to Bridgeport. The corps had come to
Nashville by railroad, but were without transportation,
therefore did not supply all the relief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
needed at Chattanooga. What was absolutely
necessary was the restoration of rail transportation
from Stevenson to Chattanooga, and not
exclusively the protection of the railroad from the
north to Bridgeport. Sufficient reinforcements
were also needed in order to enable the Union
Army to attack and destroy or drive back the
enemy, who was in too close proximity for safety;
and therefore the first thing to be considered, after
the Union troops were properly fortified, was to
plan means by which the cooperation of these
eastern reinforcements could be made available.
In preliminary preparation for this, a steamboat
which had been captured at Chattanooga, had
been repaired and another was being built at
Bridgeport. Rosecrans ordered Hooker to bring
to Bridgeport all his command, with the exception
of what was needed to protect the railroad
from Nashville to the Tennessee River. He
started also the construction of pontoons for a
bridge, at some point over the river below Chattanooga,
where his troops might have to cross
in order to meet Hooker’s forces coming from
Bridgeport, and also in order to shorten the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
road down the river. General W. F. Smith
(“Baldy Smith”) had lately been appointed
chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland.
General Rosecrans ordered him to reconnoiter the
river near Williams’s Island, a few miles below the
points of Lookout Mountain, expecting to make of
that island a steamer landing and supply depot.
This last order was issued October 19, and on that
same day General Rosecrans was relieved from
the command of the Army; and General George
H. Thomas assumed command.</p>

<p>Prior to this date, on October 9, a complete reorganization
of the Army of the Cumberland had
been made. Many of the regiments and brigades
had been so reduced in numbers by the late battle
and by sickness, that consolidation of brigades became
imperative. Besides, in order to maintain
efficiency in the army and proper discipline, a
weeding out among the general officers became a
necessity. Ever since the close of fighting at
Chickamauga, there had been an undercurrent of
feeling among the majority of the officers, that certain
ones, who had failed to meet the emergencies
which arose during that battle, could not continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
in command, without decided detriment to the future
operations of the army. In compliance with
the President’s order of September 28, the Twentieth
and Twenty-First corps were consolidated
and called the Fourth Corps. This new corps
was placed under the command of General Gordon
Granger who had particularly distinguished
himself at Chickamauga. The reserve corps was
made a part of the Fourteenth Corps. Each corps
was composed of three divisions and each division
of three brigades. The following short dispatch
sent to the Secretary of War by C. A. Dana, gives
a very concise and interesting statement of what
was done:</p>

<p>“Fourth Corps: First Division, Palmer; First
Brigade, Cruft, nine regiments, 2,044 men;
Second Brigade, Whittaker, eight regiments,
2,035 men; Third Brigade, Colonel Grose, eight
regiments, 1,968 men. Second Division, Sheridan;
First Brigade, F. T. Sherman, ten regiments,
2,385 men; Second Brigade, Wagner, eight regiments,
2,188 men; Third Brigade, Harker, 2,026
men. Third Division, Wood; First Brigade,
Willich, nine regiments, 2,069 men; Second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Brigade, Hazen, nine regiments, 2,195 men;
Third Brigade, Samuel Beatty, eight regiments,
2,222 men.</p>

<p>“Fourteenth Corps: First Division, Rousseau;
First Brigade, Carlin, nine regiments, 2,072 men;
Second Brigade, King, four regiments of regulars
and four regiments of volunteers, 2,070 men;
Third Brigade, Starkweather, eight regiments,
2,214 men. Second Division, J. C. Davis; First
Brigade, J. D. Morgan, five regiments, 2,214
men [this brigade had been in the reserve and
did not take part in the late battle]; Second
Brigade, John Beatty, seven regiments, 2,460
men; Third Brigade, Daniel McCook, six regiments,
2,099 men [this brigade had few losses
in the late battle]. Third Division, Baird;
First Brigade, Turchin, seven regiments, 2,175
men; Second Brigade, Van Derveer, seven regiments,
2,116 men; Third Brigade, Croxton, seven
regiments, 2,165 men.”</p>

<p>Those detachments of the reserve corps
which still remained along the Nashville and
Chattanooga railroad beyond Bridgeport, were
not included. The garrison at Stevenson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Bridgeport, and Battle Creek, under General J. D.
Morgan, as above stated, were however included.
The State of Tennessee was divided into two districts,
the northern, commanded by General Robert
S. Granger with headquarters at Nashville, and
the southern under General R. W. Johnson with
headquarters at Stevenson.</p>

<p>General L. H. Rousseau superseded General
R. S. Granger at Nashville, in November, prior to
the battles. General Starkweather relieved
Johnson at Stevenson after the battle, the latter
having been assigned in Rousseau’s place, as commander
of the First Division of the Fourteenth
Corps.</p>

<p>In the reorganization of the army the Wisconsin
troops were distributed as follows: The First
and Twenty-First Infantry remained in Starkweather’s
Third Brigade of the First Division of
the Fourteenth Corps; the Tenth Infantry in the
First Brigade of the same division which was
commanded by General W. P. Carlin. The
Twenty-fourth Infantry was in the First Brigade
of Sheridan’s Division, commanded by Colonel
F. T. Sherman; the Fifteenth Infantry in Willich’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
Brigade of Wood’s Division, of the Fourth
Corps. The Fifth Battery was attached to
Davis’s Division of the Fourteenth Corps; the
Third, Eighth and Tenth, and Company A of the
First Wisconsin Heavy Artillery were assigned
to the Second Division of the Artillery Reserve.
The Eleventh and Twelfth corps were not reorganized
prior to the battles; the Third and
Twenty-sixth Wisconsin Infantry remained in the
same organization in which they were in the Army
of the Potomac—viz.: the Third in Ruger’s
Third Brigade of the First Division (Williams’s)
of the Twelfth Corps; the Twenty-sixth in the
Second Brigade of the Third Division of the
Eleventh Corps.</p>

<p>When General Thomas became commander of
the Army of the Cumberland, General John M.
Palmer was made commander in his place of the
Fourteenth Corps, and General Charles Cruft
was assigned to the command of the First Division
of the Fourth Corps, in place of Palmer.</p>

<p>General James A. Garfield, chief of staff, had
been elected member of Congress from his district
in Ohio; he left in order to assume his duties and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
General J. J. Reynolds had been appointed chief
of staff in his place. General John M. Brannan
was made chief of artillery. These, with General
W. F. Smith as chief engineer, greatly added
to the strength of the headquarters staff.</p>

<p>This order of the President—which affected
these local changes in the Army of the Cumberland—was
followed by a much greater consolidation
on a very much broader scale. The Army of
the Tennessee—then in western Tennessee and
northern Mississippi—was placed under command
of General W. T. Sherman, who was on his way
with a portion of it to Chattanooga in order to
reinforce the Army of the Cumberland. The
Army of the Ohio, under General A. E.
Burnside, was at Knoxville. These three armies
had not before had a commander in
common under whose orders they could be made
to cooperate. A commander-in-chief at Washington
had so far been unable to accomplish
this very necessary cooperation. The Tennessee
River ran through the fields of operations of all the
three armies—less directly in the field of the Army
of the Tennessee—and the preceding lack of unity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
in movements jeopardized the ultimate object of
all their campaigns, namely: the re-establishment
of the former relation between the states in rebellion
and the general government. On this account
the President established the Military Division
of the Mississippi, with Lieutenant-General
U. S. Grant in command. This was a virtual
consolidation of the three armies; their cooperation
in that wide field was henceforth perfect.
Subsequent events showed the wisdom of this order.
The Confederates never won another battle
in this department; and in fourteen months after
the organization of one command there existed no
organized Confederate force in this field, worthy
of notice. There were only detachments here
and there, like Forrest’s rangers in the early spring
of 1865, until General James H. Wilson’s cavalry
raid put an end to all resistance.</p>

<p>After its reorganization, the Army of the
Cumberland was composed of the Fourth,
Eleventh, Twelfth, and Fourteenth corps, and
three divisions of cavalry. Had General Sheridan
been placed in command of the combined
cavalry, his subsequent career shows that its efficiency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
would have been greatly improved;
but all the changes, that might have been beneficial,
could not be thought of at once. The
pending events in this department developed some
pre-eminent officers, who were indeed very much
needed; they became masterful factors in the
early downfall of the rebellion, both in the east
and in the west; Sheridan was one of these; others
were Grant, Thomas, and Sherman.</p>

<p>Grant reached his new command by way of
Louisville, Kentucky, where he met the Secretary
of War, Edwin M. Stanton, who brought with
him the order of October 18, as well as General
Grant’s commission. Grant sent from Louisville
the following telegram to Thomas, “Hold Chattanooga
at all hazards. I will be there as soon as
possible. Please inform me how long your
present supplies will last, and the prospect for
keeping them up.” General Thomas answered:
“Two hundred and four thousand four hundred
and sixty-two rations in storehouses; ninety thousand
to arrive tomorrow, and all the trains were
loaded which had arrived at Bridgeport up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
16th—probably three hundred wagons. <i>I will
hold the town till we starve.</i>”</p>

<p>On October 19, Thomas ordered General
Hooker to carry out the former orders of General
Rosecrans, namely to concentrate his forces at
Bridgeport, in order to move them to Chattanooga.</p>

<p>General Grant arrived at Chattanooga on the
evening of October 23, one month after the Union
troops had taken possession of the city. On the
24th he went to Brown’s Ferry in company with
Thomas and W. F. Smith, the chief engineer;
at once he recognized the necessity and possibility
of the scheme, initiated by General Rosecrans, but
conceived and planned by W. F. Smith, of placing
a pontoon bridge there and of obtaining a hold
on the south side of the river at that point, and he
ordered its execution; much had already been
done toward preparing for it. General Smith
was given full power to complete the plan. The
river at Chattanooga runs almost directly west opposite
the city, but soon it curves to the north and
then it turns to the south with quite a sharp bend
at the foot of Lookout Mountain, from where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
river runs directly north, forming a narrow and
perfect peninsula directly opposite or west of the
city. This peninsula widens slightly at its southern
end and forms a perfect shape of a human
foot; hence it is called “Moccasin Point.”
Brown’s Ferry is directly west of the city, on the
western point of the neck of this peninsula, some
miles below Lookout. It is only about a mile in
direct line to Brown’s Ferry from the northern end
of the bridge, at the foot of Cameron Hill in the
western outskirts of the city. From Brown’s
Ferry the river continues north, and passes Williams
Island; five or more miles from the ferry,
it makes another sharp turn to the south at the foot
of Walden’s Ridge; in the course of six or seven
miles from this northern bend it flows tortuously
past Kelly’s Ferry. The peninsula thus formed,
is the northern nose of Raccoon Mountain. From
Brown’s to Kelly’s Ferry is about five miles in direct
line somewhat to the southwest, and, as said
before, it is one mile across to Chattanooga. It is
about five miles from Cameron Hill bridge to
Brown’s Ferry, but from where the boats for the
Brown’s Ferry bridge subsequently started, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
about nine miles, and to Kelly’s Ferry more than
fifteen, perhaps twenty miles. These figures
show the value to the transportation, of obtaining
unobstructed access to Kelly’s Ferry as a landing
for steamboats bringing supplies from Bridgeport
across Brown’s Ferry, when it should come into
possession of the Union Army by the advance of
Hooker, until the railroad could be repaired or
put into working order from Bridgeport to Chattanooga.
The movement of troops which accomplished
this, also, gave the army a lodgment on
the south side of the river, to meet, and assist,
Hooker’s forces coming from Bridgeport, thus
breaking the Confederate hold upon the river road
to Bridgeport. Under General Smith’s orders
and supervision, the plans were successfully carried
out. Two flatboats and fifty pontoons, with
cars, were prepared. In these, 1,500 men under
Hazen passed down the river nine miles, and close
to the Confederate pickets. They were to land
at different points in sections, the places having
been pointed out previously to the officers in command.
On account of the darkness fires were
kept burning opposite these places, so that the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
sections could land at the proper points.
The remainder of Turchin’s and Hazen’s
brigades—from which the men in the boats were
taken—and their batteries, were marched across
the peninsula, and posted out of sight in the
woods, near Brown’s Ferry on the north side of
the river.</p>

<p>The infantry troops were to cross in the boats,
as soon as the men under Hazen landed on the
south side, and recross to the north side. The artillery
was to move into position as soon as the
boats landed, in order to cover a retreat in case of
disaster. The equipment for the pontoon bridge
was also in place and ready for use. The boats
commenced to float at 3 a. m. October 27, and
they were not discovered by the enemy until 5
a. m., when the first section had landed; a portion
of the second section, which did not land in the
proper place, was fired on by the enemy’s picket,
calling forth an attack by the picket-reserve of the
enemy. But the Union troops on the north side
of the ferry crossed rapidly in the boats, pushed
forward to the top of the ridge, and in two hours
they protected themselves sufficiently with timber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
and abatis to hold the <i>tête de pont</i>. On the 27th
the bridge was completed at 4:30 p. m.; the work
was done under some shelling from Lookout
Point. Captain P. V. Fox of the First Michigan
Engineers was the skillful superintendent of
the bridge building. Twenty beeves, six pontoons,
a barge and about 2,000 bushels of corn fell
into the hands of the Union troops. The Union
loss was 6 killed, 23 wounded, and 9 missing.
Six prisoners were taken from the Confederates
and 6 were killed; how many were wounded is
not known. While the bridge was being laid,
General Hooker crossed the river at Bridgeport on
a pontoon bridge, and was marching up towards
Chattanooga. At 3 p. m. on the 28th, his head
of column reached Wauhatchie, in Lookout Valley,
at the junction of the railroad from Bridgeport,
with the branch from Trenton up the valley.
The wagon road from here to Brown’s
Ferry runs about four miles, along the western
base of a ridge, which here and there has deep
depressions; through one of these the railroad
continued to Chattanooga, around the nose of
Lookout, close to the river; through another the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
wagon road runs. General Hooker had with him
Howard’s Eleventh Corps, and Geary’s division
of the Twelfth, with the exception of one regiment
left at the bridge at Bridgeport, one at Whiteside’s
and one at Shellmound; the latter two
places being on the railroad between Bridgeport
and Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The First Division of the Twelfth Corps,
(Williams), had been left to guard the railroad
from Murfreesboro to Bridgeport. In Ruger’s
brigade of this division was the Third Wisconsin
Infantry, commanded by Colonel William Hawley.
This regiment had been mustered into the
service on June 29, 1861, and had been serving
with the Army of the Potomac since that date
until now, when it became a part of the Army of
the Cumberland. In the Second Brigade of the
Third Division, (Schurz) of the Eleventh Corps
was the Twenty-sixth Wisconsin Infantry, commanded
by Captain Frederick C. Winkler, who
was appointed Major November 17, 1863. It
was exclusively a German regiment, and was
mustered in at Milwaukee on August 17, 1862.
On the following October 6, it left Wisconsin for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
the Army of the Potomac, in which it served until
it became a part of the Eleventh Corps under
Howard and Hooker of the Army of the Cumberland.</p>

<p>Hooker’s advance troops, under General Howard,
camped that night within a mile or so of
Brown’s Ferry, where they opened communication
with the troops there. Geary’s division was
in the rear and camped near Wauhatchie, three
miles from Howard’s troops; thus the road
from Wauhatchie to Kelly’s Ferry—three miles
to the northwest of Wauhatchie—was controlled.
About 1 a. m. on the 29th, Geary was
heavily attacked by a part of Longstreet’s troops,
but not before he had his division in line for defense.
Howard was ordered to double quick his
nearest division, under command of General Carl
Schurz, to Geary’s relief. Before proceeding far,
it was fired upon from the near hills on the division’s
left, but at long range. The firing produced
no great injury to Schurz’s troops. Howard
detached one brigade to deploy on these hills,
and pushed on with the other; in the meantime
Steinwehr’s division, also of Howard’s, came up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Then it was discovered that another hill, in the
rear of Schurz was also occupied by the enemy.
Smith’s brigade charged it and carried it with the
bayonet against three times its number.</p>

<p>Hooker says, “No troops ever rendered more
brilliant service. The name of their valiant commander
is Colonel Orlando Smith of the Seventy-third
Ohio Infantry. * * * For almost
three hours, without assistance Geary repelled the
repeated attacks of vastly superior numbers, and in
the end drove them ingloriously from the field.”
Thus the Lookout Valley was secured, and
new communications were opened. The loss to
General Hooker’s command was 416. Longstreet
practically conceded that the Union commander
had succeeded in opening this new line of
communication, but spoke lightly of it. Whittaker’s
and John G. Mitchell’s brigades were subsequently
moved over to this region. The steamboat
at Chattanooga passed down on the night of
the 28th; thereafter two steamboats (one had been
built at Bridgeport), made regular trips with supplies
from Bridgeport to Kelly’s Ferry. Good
roads were made from Chattanooga via Brown’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
to Kelly’s Ferry and the railroad from Bridgeport
towards the east was being repaired. There was
no shortage of rations or forage after these rapid
preparations were commenced to attack the enemy
in his strong positions around the city. Hope and
confidence had always inspired the Army of the
Cumberland; the rank and file had never
despaired; now, they took the lead in anticipating
that the end was in sight; success in battle depends
very much on the condition of the human body and
the enthusiasm of the spirit.</p>

<p>The feeble and ineffectual efforts of Longstreet
to prevent the opening of the river, and the
advance of Hooker’s troops, opened the eyes of
all the general officers of the Army of the Cumberland
to the weakness of the Confederate Army,
both in the ranks and among the officers. General
Longstreet, in his official report of the battle
of Wauhatchie, attributes his defeat to the jealousy
of brigade officers.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The Confederate
troops, making the attack on General Geary, were
withdrawn from the east side of Lookout, but
they returned immediately before daylight on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
night of the attack. General Longstreet gave
reasons for this action; he showed that it was not
good military tactics to keep a large force on that
side of the mountain, where its only line of retreat
was around the slope of Lookout; if it were defeated,
it would be exposed to the fire of the
Union troops at and opposite Chattanooga.
These reasons were sound and foreshadowed the
ease with which Hooker’s forces, on November
24, drove the enemy so easily and captured Lookout
Mountain. It was after this defeat, that
Bragg (for reasons unknown), sent Longstreet’s
Corps toward Knoxville to assist in defeating
Burnside. Bragg hoped that it could be returned
in time to assist in the battle, that he knew must be
fought at Chattanooga. Longstreet took with
him the two divisions of McLaws and Hood, and
Alexander’s cavalry. Wheeler’s cavalry passed
him on the road; it was supposed to do certain
things that it failed to do. Longstreet recommended
that Bragg’s army should be drawn back
in a strong position behind the Chickamauga, after
the departure of Longstreet’s troops in November;
his reason for this recommendation was, that in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
present position it could be reached in twenty minutes
by the Union Army. Bragg seemed to be
blind, however, to the events so rapidly transpiring
in Chattanooga; he did not seem to realize that
the troops Longstreet had fought at Wauhatchie,
were reinforcements from the East to the Union
Army.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Confederate batteries on
Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge sent an
occasional artillery shot into the Union lines.
The pickets of the two armies held their lines
close to each other in the valley and watched each
other’s movements, firing whenever a soldier on
his beat became visible. There being no good
reason for this desultory and ineffectual warfare,
an agreement was finally reached, that the pickets
should fire only when advances of troops became
apparent; henceforth, an officer could with impunity
ride along the picket line in plain view of
the opposite pickets.</p>

<p>As soon as Grant became aware of Longstreet’s
departure for East Tennessee, he prepared for an
attack on Bragg’s army in order to keep him from
detaching more troops against Burnside and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
compel him to return those already sent. He ordered
General Thomas to assault the north end of
Missionary Ridge; the order was given November
7; but on account of the utter lack of animals—caused
not only by the great loss in the recent
battles, but also by the death of a large number
from starvation since the occupation of the city—it
was finally decided by Grant, Thomas, and
Smith, that nothing but a defensive attitude would
be feasible until General Sherman’s forces could
arrive. The necessity for aggressive operations,
on account of Bragg’s boldness in taking such a
desperate chance as to send a large force commanded
by his ablest general away from his weak
little army, increased the activity of the Union
Army in its preparation for battle, and thus was
opened a way for the relief of Burnside; the
hope was that he could hold out until help arrived.</p>

<p>It is to be presumed, that Bragg had implicit
confidence that the Union Army would not dare
to attack such a strong position as Bragg’s army
then held. General Grant at once wrote the
facts of the situation to Burnside and urged him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
to maintain his attitude at Knoxville, until a
battle could be fought at Chattanooga and a detachment
sent to his assistance. Not waiting for
Sherman, he formulated his plans; and thus knew
before the latter’s arrival, just where he should
place Sherman, what his part of the attack should
be, and that he should march immediately on his
approach directly to the north end of Missionary
Ridge. Grant planned furthermore that Hooker
should attack Lookout Mountain from his position
in Lookout Valley; the one should attack the right
of the Confederate Army and the other the left.
Sherman arrived at Bridgeport, with his leading
division, on November 15. Arriving at Chattanooga
ahead of his troops, he with Grant, Thomas,
and Smith, looked over the entire situation and
learned how, and by what route, he could reach his
point of attack. It had become apparent to the
Union commanders, that Bragg’s line did not reach
the immediate river hills, at the north end of Missionary
Ridge, but was deflected to the east, along
the third hill to the south of the river, with a deep
depression between it and the next hill to the
north. This made necessary a much stronger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
position than the supposed location at Bragg’s right
flank, and stronger forces and dispositions were
needed. Grant announced his plan to his generals
on the 18th and expected the attacks could be
made on the 21st; a rain storm delayed, however,
the arrival of Sherman’s troops. When they did
arrive at Brown’s Ferry the high water had broken
the bridge, which delayed the crossing. When the
bridge was repaired, Sherman crossed it in plain
view of the enemy’s signal station on the point of
Lookout Mountain; he marched into the woods
behind a series of hills on the north side of the
river; these hills concealed his march all the
way to the mouth of Chickamauga Creek, where
Davis’s division of the Fourteenth Corps had been
placed to cover his movement, and to protect the
bridge there, after Sherman’s troops had again
crossed to the south side. The crossing at the
Chickamauga was also protected by artillery,
placed on the heights north of the river. After
crossing at the mouth of the Chickamauga, Sherman
was to follow Missionary Ridge as far as the
railroad tunnel. This seemed to be the principal
point of attack; the plan further contemplated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
that all the forces available should be converged
toward General Sherman’s position. Therefore
Howard’s Eleventh Corps was taken from Hooker’s
position and replaced by Whittaker’s and
Grose’s brigades of the Fourth Corps; the Eleventh
Corps was placed on the left of the Army of
the Cumberland south of the river, looking towards
Sherman’s position perhaps four miles further
east. Thomas was to cooperate by moving
his troops to his left, so that he could join
with Sherman’s right, when the latter should push
the Confederate forces back to the tunnel. The
combined forces should then advance against the
enemy, with the object in view of sweeping the
Confederate Army into the south Chickamauga
Creek, which runs on the opposite side of Missionary
Ridge. General Hooker was to hold
Lookout Valley with Geary’s division and the two
brigades of Whittaker and Grose, and Howard’s
corps was to be in readiness to act with either Sherman
or Thomas, as circumstances should dictate.
The plan was a fine one, because, if that flank
could be defeated, the Confederate line of retreat
could be easily cut off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Colonel Long with his brigade of cavalry
moved to Sherman’s left. When Sherman should
sweep the ridge, he was ordered to cross the Chickamauga
and raid the rear of the Confederate
Army. This attack was to begin on the 22nd, but
was postponed on account of the fact that two of
Sherman’s divisions had not been able to cross
Brown’s Ferry bridge, on account of a break. To
avoid any further delay, Thomas suggested that
Howard’s Corps be sent to General Sherman in
place of the two delayed divisions, and that the
latter be ordered to report to General Hooker,
whose combined forces should immediately attack
Lookout Mountain in order to divert the attention
of the enemy from Sherman’s contemplated attack;
this suggestion was in part approved by General
Grant.</p>

<p>A singular thing happened on November 22.
General Ewing’s division of Sherman’s troops had
come into Lookout Valley at Trenton from
Bridgeport; Bragg’s rear was thus threatened.
The movement of some of Bragg’s troops to
avert this calamity together with the former withdrawal
of Longstreet’s Corps for Knoxville, produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
the impression in the Confederate Army,
that the whole was going to fall back. Deserters
who came into the Union line reported
this impression. Bragg also notified the Union
commander to remove all non-combatants from
the city; this was on the 20th. General Grant
ordered Thomas to make a reconnoisance in
front of Chattanooga in order to test the truth
of this report, and to find out whether Bragg
was really falling back, and if so, Thomas
should prevent him from doing it undisturbed.
The Army of the Cumberland was nearest to
the enemy and in readiness to do this with the
most celerity. It seems that General Bragg had
such confidence in the strength of his position
on the top of Missionary Ridge, about 500 feet
high, that he was willing not only to send
away Longstreet, but actually started other forces
to follow him. The latter he recalled, however,
in time to take part in the battle. He supposed,
and with good reason, that Missionary Ridge
could not be taken by assault; and even if Lookout
should become untenable on account of the
capture of the valley of Chattanooga, he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
be safe in his entrenchments on Missionary Ridge.
This must have been his conclusion, and he must
have known that the Army of the Cumberland
was receiving considerable reinforcements.
Bragg’s lines were altogether too long. When
the object of holding Lookout Mountain no
longer existed, after the reopening of the river and
railroad route to Bridgeport, he should have withdrawn
from there and from Chattanooga Valley;
he should either have concentrated on Missionary
Ridge or taken Longstreet’s advice and fallen
back to Dalton, behind the second ridge, southeast
of Chattanooga, where he was finally driven.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the success of the Union movements,
Bragg did not do the things that an abler
general would have done. He stood stolidly in
his original line along its whole length until the opening
of the battle of Missionary Ridge. It has
been stated, that Bragg expected Grant when
he discovered the departure of Longstreet for East
Tennessee, would send forces to support Burnside.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the order to make a reconnoisance,
Thomas ordered Granger, who commanded
the Fourth Corps, to advance a division of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
corps towards Orchard Knob November 23, about
noon. This elevation of land is located about
half way between the city and Missionary Ridge,
at the left of Thomas’s line. Between the Union
line and this knob was a growth of trees and
bushes. These concealed the formation of the
troops for a while only from the enemy. Wood’s
division was deployed in front of Fort Wood.
Sheridan’s division formed next on the right and
rear of Wood. Howard’s Corps was massed in the
rear of these two divisions. General Baird’s division
fell, in echelon, at the right of Sheridan.
General Johnson’s division (formerly Rousseau’s)
of the Fourteenth Corps stood with arms in the
entrenchments, ready to move in any direction.
This really placed the latter in echelon with Baird.
It is said the enemy looked upon these movements
as a parade for display or to obtain wood for fires,
when seeing them from the top of Missionary
Ridge. The Confederates had a line of rifle-pits
along the base of Orchard Knob, following Citico
Creek for a mile or more.</p>

<p>With Willich’s and Hazen’s brigades in front
and Beatty’s in reserve, General Wood moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
forward about 2 p. m. His troops pushed back
easily whatever was in their front. Willich struck
Orchard Knob squarely on his front, and soon captured
it, clearing it of the enemy’s lines. Hazen
met more resistance from the Confederates who
were perhaps more numerous or better fighters, although
the hill he attacked was not so high as Orchard
Knob. He carried the hill, however, and
captured the Twenty-eighth Alabama Regiment
and its flag. This advanced line gave a good
position for further advances, and was held;
the rest of the troops on the right moving up
to and extending the line far to the right. General
Wood fortified his line over Orchard Knob, and
General Howard formed his corps on its left.
The summit of this Knob gave a splendid outlook
over the field between it and Missionary Ridge,
and gave a fine view of the ridge itself. It afforded
an opportunity for Grant and Thomas to
view later on the whole subsequent movements
against the enemy. General Wood lost 125 men
killed and wounded in this battle of Orchard
Knob. The Fifteenth Wisconsin of Willich’s
brigade took part in this engagement; its losses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
were not reported until after the battle of the 25th,
when its commander reported 6 men slightly
wounded in both engagements. Wood occupied
this position until 3:15 p. m. on the 25th, when he
moved forward with the rest of the army to the
assault on Missionary Ridge. Bridge’s Illinois
Battery occupied an epaulment in Wood’s line on
Orchard Knob.</p>

<p>The taking of Orchard Knob had a most important
bearing on the attack that General Hooker
made on Lookout Mountain the next day. It
caused Bragg to withdraw Walker’s division from
that point to strengthen his right, which Bragg
thought to be menaced by this advance to Orchard
Knob. These troops prolonged Bragg’s line towards
Sherman’s front but did not reach it. The
Confederate general, Stevenson, signalled from
the top of Lookout to Bragg that night that if an attack
was intended by Grant, it would be delivered
on Lookout Mountain. This is what actually occurred.
Another of Sherman’s divisions crossed
Brown’s Ferry on the 23rd; the bridge was again
broken, however, leaving Osterhaus’s division still
on the left bank. This gave General Sherman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
only three divisions besides General Davis’s of the
Fourteenth Corps, with which to operate at the
designated place on Missionary Ridge. General
Thomas informed General Hooker of the proximity
of Osterhaus’s troops and directed, that if they
did not get over to Sherman, he should have them
join him and “take the point of Lookout Mountain.”
This division was at that time in command
of General Charles R. Woods, one of its brigade
commanders. How sagacious was General
Thomas in seeing immediately the advantage that
should be taken of a mere accident, like the
breaking of a pontoon bridge! It looks as though
Thomas had made this suggestion to Hooker,
without having beforehand a distinct understanding
with General Grant; for he told General
Hooker later, that Grant still hoped Woods’s (Osterhaus’s)
division could cross in time to participate
in Sherman’s movement, but if it could not
the mountain should be taken if practicable.
Hooker, finding that there was little possibility of
the bridge being quickly repaired, made preparations
for the advance against the mountain. It will
be observed further on, that this accident resulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
in modifying the original plans very materially, as
the taking of Orchard Knob had already done.
The left of Bragg’s line was turned, but not his
right; this movement was a result of the accidents
to the Brown’s Ferry pontoon bridge. General
Grant showed his broad mind in this affair as well
as in other changes he made in his original plan,
at a later date.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN</h3>

<p>At 4 p. m. on November 24, 1863, one of the
most spectacular battles of the war commenced.
General Hooker’s force consisted of the following:
Osterhaus’s division of the Fifteenth Corps,
Cruft’s (formerly Palmer’s) of the Fourth;
Geary’s of the Twelfth—with the exception
of such regiments from the last two divisions
as were required to protect the communications
with Bridgeport and Kelly’s Ferry; battery K of
the First Ohio, and battery I of the First New
York of the Eleventh Corps, having sufficient
horses for but one battery; a part of the Second
Kentucky Cavalry, and Company K of the Fifteenth
Illinois Cavalry. The aggregate number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
of this force was 9,681. The foregoing statement
of the forces is taken from General Hooker’s official
report<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, which is remarkably well written,
clear in statement and full of essential facts. “At
this time the enemy’s pickets formed a continuous
line along the right bank of Lookout Creek, with
the reserves in the valley, while his main force was
encamped in a hollow half way up the slope of
the mountain. The summit itself was held by
three brigades of Stevenson’s division, and those
were comparatively safe, as the only means of access
from the next [that is, from the valley in
which Hooker’s troops were located] for a distance
of 20 miles up the valley was by two or
three trails, admitting to the passage of but 1
man at a time; and even these trails were held at
the top by rebel pickets.”</p>

<p>The top of Lookout Mountain at this point consists
of a perpendicular crest, or palisade of rocks
which rises out of the main body of the mountain
about a hundred feet. From the foot of this crest
the mountain slopes by a gradual descent but with
a very broken surface on all sides to the valleys on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the east, west, and to the river on the north. An
army could operate on this slope only below
the crest, from the west to the east, or on the side
of Chattanooga, around the northern slope, under
the crest. Hooker’s army did not cross the top of
the crest; but by taking the slope, the Confederate
troops occupying the top, were forced to retreat
by the only wagon road reaching to the top on the
Chattanooga side. The slope on that side
is less precipitous than on the west side where
Hooker was. At the foot of the slope on
the Chattanooga side flows the Chattanooga Creek
and on the west side Lookout Creek, both flowing
north, practically parallel with the trend of the
mountain, and emptying into the Tennessee River,
which runs west at the foot of the northern slope.
Hooker continues his report as follows: “On the
northern slope midway between the summit and
the Tennessee, a plateau or belt of arable land,
encircles the crest. There, a continuous line of
earth-works had been thrown up, while redoubts,
redans, and pits appeared lower down the slope
to repel an assault from the direction of the river.”</p>

<p>Geary commenced his movements as instructed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
crossed the creek at 8 o’clock a. m., “captured the
entire picket of 42 men posted to defend it, marched
directly up the mountain until his right rested
on the palisades, and headed down the valley.”
The Confederate Walthall was in command of
the troops immediately opposed to Geary, and
Moore’s brigade near the Craven house on the eastern,
or northeastern slope. General Stevenson was
there in command of all the Confederate troops on
the mountain. He placed sharpshooters along
the western edge of the crest, and wherever there
was depression enough, the artillery by raising the
trails of the gun carriages did some execution
until Geary’s troops reached the foot of the
palisades. The Confederate troops located on
the western slope, moved into position, facing
Lookout Creek, in order to prevent the Union
troops crossing at the bridge; but this disposition
subjected them to a flank enfilading fire from
Geary’s troops. The other Union troops moved
up the Creek, crossed behind Geary’s line, and
joined on his left. The batteries had been
placed on elevated points, so as to enfilade the
route by which the enemy had to march down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
the slope, and on other points, by which the Confederates
had to retreat if they were driven back.
The Union line advanced, the artillery opened.
The rout of the enemy was complete, many prisoners
were taken, and many were killed and
wounded. At noon when Geary’s advance
rounded the northern slope, his flags were plainly
visible from Chattanooga. There had been a fog
all morning, which greatly favored Hooker’s
movements, preventing the Confederates on top of
the crest from directing their shots satisfactorily.
As the Union flags appeared on the sky line of the
northern slope, and were visible at Chattanooga,
this fog settled down upon the lower stretches
of the slope and revealed the Confederate lines
badly broken and in flight with the compact
ranks of the Union soldiers triumphantly advancing
with flags flying and muskets glistening
in the sun. It was a glorious sight to the Union
troops, then in line in front of the works at Chattanooga.
The picture presented was a “battle
above the clouds,” for the fog obscured all that
part of the mountain which was below the conquering
lines of Hooker. General Stevenson says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
in his report, with regard to this affair: “Finding
that the fog was becoming so dense that the troops
on the northern part of the mountain [meaning
Pettus’s brigade on the crest] could not see the
enemy moving upon Walthall, I gave orders for
Pettus with my only disposable force to move
down and report to Brigadier-General Jackson.
He started at 12:30 o’clock and reached the
scene of action a little past 1 o’clock. * * *
This position was held by Moore, Walthall, and
Pettus until about 8 p. m.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Stevenson had six brigades in his command;
four of these took part in the fight on the mountain,
the other two were placed between Chattanooga
Creek and the road up the slope, in order to guard
the line of retreat on the east side of the mountain
against any advance from Chattanooga. Stevenson
reports, that he lost only 380 in his three
brigades; he does not state the number of troops
he had on the mountain. Hooker rested at
2 o’clock p. m. after passing the point. The
settling down of the fog shut off his view of the
Chattanooga Valley and prevented his seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
sufficiently the topography to justify him in advancing
down into the valley that same evening.
He formed his lines on the eastern slope; his right
was at the palisades, and his left was near the
mouth of Chattanooga Creek. This line he
fortified, and reported the fact to the department
commander. In this position he enfiladed the
enemy’s line in the Chattanooga Valley, and also
had communication across the mouth of the creek
with the Union forces in the city. At 5:15 p. m.
General Carlin’s brigade of Johnson’s division of
the Fourteenth Corps, reported to General Hooker
after having crossed the mouth of the creek by
ferry; he was placed on the right of the line relieving
Geary’s troops, which were almost exhausted
with fatigue. During the night the
enemy withdrew entirely, leaving behind 20,000
rations, and the camp and garrison equipage of
three brigades. General Thomas reported, that
Hooker captured 500 or 600 prisoners. The
Eighth Kentucky Infantry scaled the crest about
daylight on the 25th and hoisted the United States
flag amid wild and prolonged cheers from the
whole army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>At ten o’clock a. m. on the 25th, leaving two
regiments to hold the mountain, Hooker started
towards Rossville, across Chattanooga Creek and
the valley, with Osterhaus’s division of the Fifteenth
Corps in the lead. Thus the left of the
Confederate Army was completely turned, while
the right still held its own. Hooker was too far
from the Confederate line of retreat to menace it.
To have turned the right first would have been
better. Hooker was delayed four hours by a destroyed
bridge in crossing Chattanooga Creek.
The Tenth Wisconsin Infantry of Carlin’s
brigade of Johnson’s division of the Fourteenth
Corps participated in this engagement; it was
detached from the brigade, and held a fort south
of the Crutchfield house on the east side of the
mountain; its losses were not reported.</p>

<p>While these operations were occurring on Lookout
Mountain under the command of Hooker,
Sherman advanced across the Tennessee River
at the mouth of the Chickamauga with three
divisions of the Army of the Tennessee, and
one division (Davis’s) of the Army of the Cumberland,
on the morning of the 24th, against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
other or extreme right wing of the Confederate
line on Missionary Ridge. He advanced and
formed his lines on the north end of the ridge; a
brigade of Howard’s Corps moved to the left at 9
a. m. on the same day and communicated with
Sherman about noon. Later Howard joined
Sherman with his two divisions and formed on his
right. Carlin’s brigade rejoined his division on
the 25th, which was then in the valley half way to
Missionary Ridge and on the right of Thomas’s
line. Palmer’s and Granger’s corps were held in
readiness by Thomas to advance to the foot of the
ridge, as soon as Hooker should get into position
at Rossville. It was after 2 p. m. that General
Hooker effected a crossing of Chattanooga Creek
and advanced as above stated. At noon General
Sherman was heavily engaged with the enemy in
his position, and finding it to be very strong was
not making any headway against it. General
Baird was, therefore, ordered to march his division
within supporting distance of Sherman, and to
move promptly.</p>

<p>He reported to Sherman, but the latter told
him he could not find room for him and could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
make use of his troops. General Baird marched
back a distance of about two miles, and arrived
at the left of General Thomas’s line at 2:30 p. m.;
he was ordered to fall in on the left of Wood, the
left division of Grangers Fourth Corps.</p>

<p>It will be well at this time to take a rapid view
of the entire lines of the Union and the Confederate
armies, as they stood facing each other, arms
in hand, at 3 o’clock p. m. on November 25, 1863,
just before they grappled in a struggle for
life and death, and for the permanent possession
of the stronghold of the Middle West. So many
changes having occurred in the previous three or
four days in the Union Army, and equally as
many and more important changes occurring on the
Confederate side, makes it necessary to pause, just
before describing the great spectacular battle of
Missionary Ridge, and try to get at least a bird’s-eye
view of the position of the numerous divisions
and corps.</p>

<p>General Osterhaus had again taken command
of his own division, relieving General Charles R.
Woods; General Cruft, and General Geary
were near enough with their troops to the ridge at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Rossville to form the extreme right of the Union
line. There was an interval between Geary’s left
and Johnson’s right, where Carlin stood after
coming from Lookout. Johnson had only two
brigades, Carlin on the right, and Stoughton
(John H. King’s successor) on the left; Starkweather
had been left in the works around the
city. Hooker’s and Thomas’s troops were without
reserves. Sheridan’s three brigades, F. T. Sherman’s,
Harkers’s and Wagner’s were next to the
left of Johnson; then Wood’s three brigades, Hazen’s,
Willich’s, and Beatty’s; the latter appeared
in two lines, being the last in Thomas’s
section, and forming the left flank of the line; and
then Baird’s three brigades, Turchin’s, Van Derveer’s
and Phelps’s.</p>

<p>A mile and a half to the left of General
Thomas’s line lay Sherman’s right flank, with no
troops in the interval. The latter’s line was composed
from right to left of the following brigades,
viz.: Buschbeck’s, Ewing’s Matthies’s, Corse’s
and A. Smith’s; Raum, was behind Matthies,
and two brigades of J. E. Smith’s were in reserve
behind the centre. Behind this line, a half mile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
in the fortified line lay from left to right the
brigades of Loomis, Cockerill, Alexander, and
Lightburn, and Schurz’s division. Sherman thus
had six divisions. The Confederate line from
its right, which faced Sherman, was as follows
by divisions: Cleburne, Stevenson, Gist, Cheatham,
Anderson, Bate, and Stewart. Stewart
held the left of Bragg’s line, and his troops were
the first to encounter those of Hooker on their way
to Rossville from Lookout Mountain. General
Hardee commanded the right wing, consisting of
the following four divisions: Cheatham, Cleburne,
Stevenson, and Walker; General Breckenridge
was in charge of the left wing, which
was composed of Bate, Stewart, and Anderson.
Cheatham’s division faced Baird, Anderson’s
Wood; Bate’s Sheridan, and Stewart’s
Johnson. Cleburne’s division reached the front
of Sherman’s line on the afternoon of the 24th
while marching from the Confederates’ left.
Before the fight of the 25th occurred, Cheatham’s,
Stevenson’s, and Walker’s divisions had prolonged
Bragg’s line to within three-quarters of a
mile of the tunnel; Smith’s brigade of Cleburne’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
division held Tunnel Hill on the 25th
against Sherman; the rest of the division was not
heavily engaged, but it had the assistance of
Brown’s and Cumming’s brigades of Stevenson’s
division, and Maney’s of Walker’s. Tunnel
Hill was not captured by Sherman’s troops until
after the retreat of these Confederate forces on the
evening of the 25th, the result of the successful assault
in the centre by Thomas.</p>

<p>The whole Confederate line on the left across
the Chattanooga Valley was abandoned; Stewart
withdrew to the top of the ridge before
Hooker reached Rossville. It must be noticed,
that General Thomas’s line in the centre, contained
only four divisions of the Army of the
Cumberland, namely two of the Fourth Corps,
and two of the Fourteenth; one division (Davis’s)
of the Fourteenth Corps was with Sherman on
the left, and one (Cruft’s) was with Hooker on
the right. Hooker had three divisions and Sherman
six.</p>

<p>Starkweather’s brigade of Johnson’s division
was left to hold the original works around Chattanooga;
and did so during the assault of the rest of
the troops upon Missionary Ridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>At 1 p. m. on the 12th, C. A. Dana, Assistant
Secretary of War, who was in Chattanooga, sent
this dispatch to the Secretary of War at Washington,
“In our front here [meaning Thomas’s
front], Confederate rifle-pits are fully manned,
preventing Thomas gaining ridge.” At 4:30
p. m. he sent another dispatch showing how misleading
the former dispatch was: “Glory to
God. The day is decisively ours. Missionary
Ridge has just been carried by a magnificent
charge of Thomas’s troops, and rebels routed.”
The reader must not lay much stress on the time
given, at which the various movements were made;
this is a mere guess in most instances. Seldom
did an officer think of looking at his watch, at the
moment any orders were given to make an important
movement. The original Army of the Cumberland,
referred to by Dana, were the troops
General Grant thought would not fight, because
they had been so roughly handled at Chickamauga.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
It was quite a natural conclusion.
The entire Union Army was in line at about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
3:30 p. m., ready for any commands which
might be given by Grant, Thomas, Sherman and
Hooker. The array of soldiers in the Union
ranks from the three armies, those of the Potomac,
the Cumberland, and the Tennessee, was formidable,
commanded by such heroes as Grant,
Thomas, Sherman, Hooker, Sheridan, and Howard.
Thomas’s four divisions had about 18,000
in rank and file, Hooker’s about 9,000, and Sherman’s
about 24,000.</p>

<p>It is not likely that Bragg had more than
30,000; but his position was sufficiently strong to
almost equal Grant’s advantage in numbers. The
Confederate Army was concentrated on a 500 feet
ridge, which had a very steep and rough surface,
sloping towards the Union lines at an angle of
about forty-five degrees. This ridge had a
fortified line on the top, manned by veteran infantry
and artillery, and a thinner line of infantry
at its foot in a series of deep rifle-pits; in
front of the latter was a swarm of skirmishers.
The army was still in command of Braxton
Bragg, a commander of great experience; and of
two wing commanders, Hardee a veteran of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
old regular army, and Breckenridge a former vice-president
of the United States. Its division commanders
were, as a rule, soldiers of the old
regular United States Army, and were very
capable officers. That army had two months before
(or thought it had) won the battle of Chickamauga,
and it was now fighting—at least in the
centre where Thomas’s troops faced them—the
same troops they claimed to have defeated a short
time ago. It had every advantage of position
at this time, and it had success in the past to fire the
hearts of its soldiers, and arouse in them confidence
in their ability to hurl back their old foe,
who had the audacity to assault so formidable a
stronghold.</p>

<p>Standing on any of the Union forts at Chattanooga,
especially on Fort Negley or Fort Wood,
or better still on Orchard Knob, where Grant and
Thomas remained during the 25th, one would
have not only a rear view of the Union Army as it
stood, but also a front view of most of the Confederate
force. From the top of Missionary
Ridge, where Bragg had his headquarters, the
whole panorama was magnificent. The lines of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
blue, and their array of glittering muskets, could
be seen from there in front. The backs of the
troops were turned on Chattanooga. “Their
faces were to the foe.” Bragg had a view of
them which Grant and Thomas missed, and if
he could have had an hour undisturbed by
the conflicting emotions aroused in him by the
pending conflict, if he could have watched
through his field-glass the valorous mien, the
confident air, and the evident determination of
these veteran soldiers, to “feed fat the ancient
grudge” against the old foes they had met at
Mill Springs, Perryville, Stone’s River, and
Chickamauga, he would surely have read in these
characteristics the doom of the defeat which
an hour later overwhelmed him and his little army,
and from which it never sufficiently recovered to
win another battle. Had he been half as much of
a philosopher, as he was a soldier, he would have
foreseen, what afterwards was expressed by one of
his ablest generals (D. H. Hill), that the holding
of Chattanooga “sealed the fate of the confederacy.”</p>

<p>The living, moving lines of soldiers, presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
to the view of the two opposing commanders, stationed
at vantage points above the valley in which
the Union Army was then formed, although a
most interesting picture, was more impressive because
of its background of magnificent mountains,
rivers, and hills. On the west rose great Lookout
Mountain, 1,500 feet above the level of the valley;
while across the valley, east of Lookout,
Missionary Ridge stretched from the north to the
South, rising 500 feet and crowned by the lines
of grey soldiers, every movement of whom could
be seen from Orchard Knob.</p>

<p>General Grant’s most excellent plan on the 24th
was that Thomas’s troops should bear to the left,
join with the right of Sherman after his forces
had advanced to the tunnel, through which the
railroad from Chattanooga to East Tennessee
ran, and together they should make an assault with
the whole union line. Thomas’s troops were in
line until 3:30 p. m. on the 25th, waiting for
Sherman to capture the hill over the tunnel.
General Sherman had begun the fight early in the
morning of the 25th by advancing Corse’s brigade;
the latter moved down the southern slope of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
second hill which had been gained the day before,
and under a galling fire advanced against Cleburne’s
fortified position. This position was very
strong, however, and Corse could not drive the
enemy from the hill. Then other brigades were
brought up, but they did not succeed in loosening
Cleburne’s firm hold. General Grant observing
this from Orchard Knob sent the rest of Howard’s
Corps to Sherman’s aid at 10 a. m. Howard
had two divisions, Steinwehr’s and Schurz’s.
It was evident, that Bragg endeavored most
vigorously to keep Sherman from turning his right.
Had Sherman succeeded in his effort, he
would have been in Bragg’s rear and able to
menace his line of retreat at Chickamauga station,
which was immediately in the rear of the
right flank. There was no evidence, however,
that Bragg was weakening his lines in front
of Thomas; although he had already sent
the forces, which Hooker had defeated the day
before on Lookout, to his right wing; and these
proved to be amply able to hold so strong a natural
fortress without any further reinforcements.
When General Sherman received Howard’s two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
divisions, he renewed his efforts to take Tunnel
Hill; he made a charge and received one in
return, which broke some of John E. Smith’s
brigades.</p>

<p>It appears that Grant did not contemplate any
attack by Thomas on the centre, when he at noon
ordered Baird to report to Sherman; for with
Baird’s he had already detached nearly half of
Thomas’s troops to Sherman and Hooker. With
Baird gone, Thomas had only eight brigades to
Sherman’s seven divisions; General Hooker had
seven brigades as far from General Thomas’s
right, as General Sherman’s were from the latter’s
left.</p>

<p>General Grant and General Thomas were together
when these orders were given on the 25th;
they were in accordance with Grant’s original
plan, that Bragg’s defeat should be accomplished
by Sherman’s turning the enemy’s right. Grant
must therefore have consulted with Thomas concerning
this maneuver. Whether General Thomas
expressed his opinion on the 25th with regard
to making the attack in some other
place than at Sherman’s line, is not known;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
but it will be seen, that the success of the day
pivoted around Thomas, because of the invincible
position of the enemy at Tunnel Hill, and the
valor of the old Army of the Cumberland. This
is no disparagement to General Grant’s original
idea; his plans were generally correct and successful,
and this one was fine in conception, but it
shows definitely, that the “best laid schemes,
o’mice and men, gang aft a’gley.”</p>

<p>General Grant boldly made his third deviation
from his original outline planned for the battle.
Seeing the improbability of Sherman advancing
his present line to join with Thomas’s left, as contemplated,
he ordered an independent assault by
Thomas’s troops alone; this order was given at 3
p. m. This section of the Union line was covered
by two lines of skirmishers; and was confronted by
something less than four divisions of the enemy,
namely, a part of Stewart’s on the Confederate
left, which was facing Hooker’s line under General
Breckenridge’s personal direction. The signal
for the advance was to be six shots from a battery
(perhaps Bridge’s), on Orchard Knob. General
Grant’s report will best tell what occurred, viz.:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
“Thomas was accordingly directed to move forward
his troops, constituting our center, * * *
with a double line of skirmishers thrown out, followed
in easy supporting distance by the whole
force, and carry the rifle-pits at the foot of Missionary
Ridge, and when carried to reform his
lines, on the rifle-pits with a view to carry the top
of the ridge. These troops moved forward,
drove the enemy from the rifle-pits at the base of
the ridge like bees from a hive—stopped but a
moment until the whole were in line—and commenced
the ascent of the mountain from right to
left almost simultaneously, following closely the
retreating enemy, without further orders. They
encountered a fearful volley of grape and canister
from near thirty pieces of artillery and musketry
from still well-filled rifle-pits on the summit of the
ridge. Not a waver, however, was seen in all
that long line of brave men. Their progress was
steadily onward until the summit was in their possession.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>When the summit was reached by the Union
troops, the scene of confusion and flight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Confederate forces, down the eastern slope of the
ridge, was wonderful to behold.</p>

<p>General Thomas in his report,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> says: “Our
troops advancing steadily in a continuous line, the
enemy, seized with panic, abandoned the works
at the foot of the hill and retreated precipitately to
the crest, where they were closely followed by our
troops, who, apparently inspired by the impulse of
victory, carried the hill simultaneously at six different
points, and so closely upon the heels of
the enemy, that many of them were taken prisoners
in the trenches. We captured all their cannon
and ammunition before they could be removed or
destroyed.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Hooker was advancing toward
Thomas’s right with his line stretched across
the ridge, at right angles to it. Stewart’s troops,
seeing their left threatened by Hooker, tried to escape
down the eastern slope toward Ringgold, but
encountering there Osterhaus’s troops, moved
northward along the base; here they ran into Johnson’s
division, and more than a thousand were captured.
After General Baird’s division had gained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
the summit, Stewart wheeled his division to the
left, across the crest, and advanced toward the
troops, resisting General Sherman. He had not advanced
far before he met Cheatham’s forces in line
across the crest; the contest here lasted until after
dark. During the night all the Confederate
forces retreated across the Chickamauga, burned
the bridges, and continued their flight to Taylor’s
Ridge, near Ringgold, the nearest heights across
the Chickamauga Valley, sixteen miles in a
straight line southeast. General Sheridan, after
halting a few moments on top of the ridge to reform
his troops, pushed on to Chickamauga Creek;
he captured 300 prisoners, 13 cannon, and a train
of 12 wagons.</p>

<p>Mr. C. A. Dana sent a dispatch to the Secretary
of War at 10 a. m. November 26, which contained
the following paragraph: “The storming
of the ridge by our troops was one of the greatest
miracles in military history. No man who climbs
the ascent by any of the roads that wind along its
front can believe that 18,000 men were moved up
its broken and crumbling face unless it was his
fortune to witness the deed. It seems as awful as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
visible interposition of God. Neither Grant, nor
Thomas intended it. Their orders were to carry
the rifle-pits along the base of the ridge, and capture
their occupants; but when this was accomplished,
the unaccountable spirit of the troops bore
them bodily up those impracticable steeps, over the
bristling rifle-pits on the crest, and the thirty cannon
enfilading every gully.”</p>

<p>General Grant says in his report that he intended
the lines should be readjusted and ascend
the ridge if they were successful at the base. The
reports of the corps and division commanders indicate
that some of them misunderstood the orders.
The men advanced without special orders, however,
when they found the position at the foot of
the ridge too much exposed to the plunging fire of
the enemy. In some instances they were even
called back to the foot after proceeding part way
up the hill. The assault was made, however, and
was so successful, that no one was court-martialed;
no one was bold enough to repudiate the responsibility
for its initiation. General Grant did not
hesitate to modify his original plans from time to
time, when inevitable circumstances showed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
that some other movement than the one laid down
was essential to success. This characteristic
is the quality of a great general.</p>

<p>The artillery also under command of General
Brannan did fine service during the assault. The
large guns in Forts Wood, Sherman, Cheatham,
and battery Rousseau directed their fire first upon
the Confederate line at the foot of the ridge, as
did four light batteries in front of Chattanooga.
When the Union line was ascending the ridge,
this artillery turned their shots to the entrenched
Confederate line on top. The enemy’s artillery
and musketry seemed largely to have over-shot
the Union lines; the records do not show that
the Union troops suffered as heavy losses during
the time they were under fire, as the enemy’s apparently
advantageous position would warrant.
It is also probable that the audacity of the blue
coats in assaulting the top of the ridge surprised the
Confederates and induced nervousness, wild
shooting, terror, confusion, and flight.</p>

<p>The Union troops did not advance up the ridge
as if on parade; but conformed more or less to the
contour of the ground; the line appeared to an onlooker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
as a zigzag one; but the standards were always
where they ought to be, and there were no
stragglers. They did not fire their muskets to any
extent while advancing, although they received
a constant wild fire from the enemy. It was an
assault by the musket bearers, and it is not likely
they received many orders from their officers. As
soon as the Union troops gained the crest at one
point, although it appeared as if the six different
points were gained simultaneously, it greatly
assisted the rest of the troops, who were so near the
crest. The Confederates began to fall back as soon
as the first Union troops gained the top. General
Bragg tried to send his troops from a less threatened
point to one more in danger, but his attempt
failed, because his men saw better than he seemed
to do that all was lost when one point was carried.
This observation applies only of course to the isolated
line on the right and left of Bragg’s
headquarters, which was attacked by General
Thomas’s troops. His troops further to the right,
beyond an unoccupied space—such as Cheatham’s
division—were not affected that way, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
they turned on left wheel, and attacked Baird’s
division on the crest.</p>

<p>The Union troops, which were called back to
the foot of the ridge by those officers who thought
their orders carried them only thus far, caused
Bragg to believe that they had been repulsed
by the fire of his troops; he rode along his
line congratulating them, when he was informed
that his line was broken further to the
right, and the Union forces had crowned the
ridge. The victory was gained too late in the
evening to ensure an effective pursuit. The enemy
had all night, after crossing the Chickamauga, in
which to move undisturbed his troops and wagon
trains; he made the distance between himself and
the pursuing force as great as possible before morning.
General Grant was apparently justified in
waiting for Hooker to arrive at Rossville before
he ordered Thomas’s advance, but he was not justified
in waiting so long as he did for Sherman’s
expected capture of Tunnel Hill. Yet who
could hope or believe that Thomas’s troops could
successfully assault so formidable a position as
they did? Hooker was delayed four hours in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
crossing Chattanooga Creek. If Grant had sent
Howard’s Corps at 10 a. m. on the 25th to Rossville
in Hooker’s place, instead of sending it to
Sherman, and as soon as it was in position, ordered
Thomas, Howard, and Sherman to advance in
unison, the same result would have occurred at
one or two o’clock as was secured much later,
and then the four and a half or five hours
of daylight would have been sufficient to injure
the Confederate Army very greatly before it
could have crossed the Chickamauga. But it is
very easy to look back and criticise. On the battlefield
there may be reasons, apparent to a commander,
why these supposable movements could
not be made that are not so palpable to a historian,
who may lose sight of all the complex situations,
the inside knowledge of the commander, and his
fearful responsibility to the country.</p>

<p>The pursuit was taken up on the morning of the
26th by General Hooker’s troops and Palmer’s
Fourteenth Corps. Hooker attacked the enemy
in a strong position at Ringgold Gap on Taylor’s
Ridge; he lost heavily without inflicting corresponding
injury on the enemy. The Fourth Corps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
was marched back to the city on the morning of
the 26th to make preparations for the relief of
Burnside at Knoxville.</p>

<p>On the 27th, the pursuit was abandoned at
Ringgold, twenty-three miles by rail south of
Chattanooga. General Grant telegraphed from
that place at 2 p. m. to General Halleck at Washington,
D. C.: “I am not prepared to continue
pursuit further.” The official reports neither
give the strength of the Union Army nor of the
Confederate Army. At the time of the attack
on Missionary Ridge the Union Army outnumbered
largely the Confederate Army. A large
part of this disparity in numbers was offset by
the extraordinarily strong position of the Confederate
forces, and the fact that the Union
Army was the aggressor. Could Bragg have
commanded the resources that Grant did, he
would have gladly availed himself of them in
order to outnumber the Union Army; no false
notions of chivalry prevented either army from
availing itself of any great advantage in battle,
which is habitually taken where war is waged.
The Confederate boast at the beginning of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
war that one Confederate could out-fight five
Yankees—as all northern troops were called by
the Confederates—was rather incompatible with
their complaint after the war, that they were
crushed only by weight of numbers.</p>

<p>Military skill will sometimes win battles against
numbers; this was not the case in the battles
around Chattanooga, however. Bragg does not
give his losses in his official report; but he lost to
the Union Army in prisoners 6,142 men, 42
pieces of artillery, 69 gun carriages, and 7,000
stands of small arms. He destroyed much other
material before and during his flight.</p>

<p>The Union less was 5,286 killed and wounded,
and 330 missing. These losses seem small compared
with other battles of less importance—Chickamauga
for instance; but it must be remembered
that the sacrifice for the continued possession
of Chattanooga by the Union Army includes
also all the losses of the conflicts of the Tullahoma
campaign, of Chickamauga, Wauhatchie,
Lookout Mountain, Orchard Knob, and Missionary
Ridge. When it is considered how much
these battles meant, in their causal effect on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
final suppression of the rebellion itself, their value
becomes apparent.</p>

<h3>WISCONSIN TROOPS IN THE BATTLE OF MISSIONARY
RIDGE</h3>

<p>Wisconsin’s part in the battle of Missionary
Ridge was important and honorable. The First
and Twenty-first Infantry were in Starkweather’s
brigade of Johnson’s division. This brigade had
lost heavily at Chickamauga; it was assigned to
remain in Chattanooga in order to hold the works,
while the army was assaulting the ridge. This
duty was cheerfully and thoroughly done, although
it deprived the brigade of the glory of
charging up the ridge.</p>

<p>The Tenth Infantry remained on detached duty
holding a fort south of the Crutchfield house, on
the side of Lookout Mountain, and did not ascend
the ridge.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth Infantry was attached to Willich’s
brigade of Wood’s division of Granger’s
fourth corps; it was commanded by Captain John
A. Gordon. In the ascent of the ridge it was in
the reserve line of the brigade, therefore its loss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
was nominal; the entire loss during the battles was
6 men wounded. General Willich speaks of
the regiment in high terms in his report. It consisted
only of 130 men.</p>

<p>Before coming to the Army of the Cumberland
the Fifteenth Infantry had distinguished itself.
On October 19, 1862, Major Quincy McNeill
of the Second Illinois Cavalry wrote to the Governor
of Wisconsin, from Island Number Ten, that
there was no braver man in the service than Captain
John A. Gordon.</p>

<p>The Eighteenth Infantry came with Sherman’s
troops of the Army of the Tennessee; it was commanded
by Colonel Gabriel Bouck and attached
to the First Brigade (Alexander’s), of the Second
Division (General John E. Smith’s), of the Seventeenth
Corps. This infantry regiment was engaged
with Sherman’s troops on the extreme left;
its losses are not reported. It was organized at
Milwaukee in February, 1862, and was mustered
in March. It proceeded to Pittsburg Landing,
Tennessee, and became a part of the Army
of the Tennessee on April 5, 1862. This regiment
was heavily engaged in the battle at that place on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
April 6; also in the battle of Corinth and other
engagements prior to its coming to Chattanooga.
The Eighteenth Infantry was noted for the size of
its men; it was said that Company G of this regiment
averaged by actual weight 160 pounds to the
man. At the battle of Pittsburg Landing on
April 6, 1862, this regiment was in the left brigade
of General Prentiss’s division; it was then
commanded by its first colonel, J. S. Alban. It
formed for battle only thirty rods from its
tents, and fifteen minutes later the Confederate line
was upon it. The enemy outflanked and overpowered
it; Alban was wounded, and carried from
the field, dying soon afterwards; the Lieutenant-Colonel
was also wounded and Major Crane was
killed. All this occurred one week after the regiment
left its camp of organization in Wisconsin.
Captain Gabriel Bouck, Company E, Second
Wisconsin Infantry was made Colonel of the
Eighteenth on April 22, 1862.</p>

<p>The Twenty-fourth Infantry was attached to
Francis T. Sherman’s Brigade of Sheridan’s division
of the Fourth Corps, and was commanded
by Major Carl Von Baumbach. His official report<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
is a vivid account of how the top of the ridge
was gained, “My regiment advanced in admirable
line of battle up to the first pits of the enemy. Upon
reaching the first line, the men were pretty much
exhausted, and unable to move for some time. In
about five minutes, however, we moved over the
first pits of the enemy, but after advancing beyond
the first line, the line of battle was not regular.
The men took advantage of all obstacles, in the
way, for shelter, and thus advanced toward the
top of the ridge. The fighting was fierce and severe,
but owing to the formation of the ground
my men were able to screen themselves partially,
from the deadly volleys, that were being hurled
at us, at every step of our advance. In the course
of the ascent my men had to rest several times on
account of exhaustion. But at length we succeeded
in gaining the crest of the ridge, after two hours
steady fighting * * * I would most respectfully
mention Adjutant Arthur McArthur, Jr.,
for his bravery. When the color sergeant was
exhausted he carried the flag in front of the regiment,
cheering the men to follow him up the
ridge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>The loss of the Twenty-fourth is given as 31
killed and wounded. Captain Howard Greene
and Lieutenant Robert J. Chivas were killed.
Captain Richard H. Austin and Lieutenant
Thomas E. Balding were wounded. Major Von
Baumbach commended especially the bravery of
the latter two.</p>

<p>The Twenty-sixth Infantry, still in the second
brigade of Schurz’s division of the Eleventh
Corps, was commanded by Major F. C. Winkler;
this regiment followed the movements of its
brigade and on November 25, was with Sherman
on the extreme left. Its losses are not reported.</p>

<p>The Third, Eighth, and Tenth light batteries
were in the First Brigade of the Second Division
of the artillery reserve. Company C of the first
heavy artillery was in the Second Brigade of the
same division.</p>

<p>The Eighth Battery did excellent service on the
evening of the 24th, when Carlin’s brigade crossed
Chattanooga Creek at its mouth and joined
Hooker. Lieutenant O. German, commanding
the battery, placed two sections near the mouth of
the creek on its right bank, and shelled the Confederate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
position and the road up the east of the
mountain. On the 25th, after the infantry had
taken Missionary Ridge it ascended to the crest.
Losses, none.</p>

<p>The Fifth Battery was part of the artillery
which was so placed as to cover the pontoon
bridge at the mouth of the Chickamauga, where
Sherman’s troops crossed on the 24th.</p>

<p>The Twelfth Battery was placed on a hill near
the location of the Fifth Battery.</p>

<p>The Sixth and Twelfth batteries were attached
officially to the Second Division of the Seventeenth
Corps; therefore they were on the left with
Sherman during the 25th. Their losses are not
reported.</p>

<p>There is no report from the Tenth Battery,
which was stationed at Harrison’s Landing, about
twelve miles up the river, east of Chattanooga; a
section of this battery reported to Colonel Eli
Long (of the cavalry) at Calhoun, Tennessee.</p>

<p>Battery C of the First Regiment of Wisconsin
Heavy Artillery was mustered in October 1,
1863; it was sent directly to Chattanooga and assigned
to Fort Wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>The Sixth Wisconsin Battery was mustered
into service at Racine, Wisconsin, October 2,
1861. It did not leave the State until March 15,
1862, when it went to St. Louis. It took part in
the siege of Island Number Ten, the siege and battle
of Corinth, and the siege of Vicksburg. This
battery came to Chattanooga with the Fifteenth
Corps under Sherman.</p>

<p>The Tenth Wisconsin Light Battery was mustered
into the service at Milwaukee on February
10, 1862, with Captain Yates V. Beebe as commander.
It left the State March 18 and went to
St. Louis. From there it joined the Army of the
Tennessee and took part in the battle of Corinth.
On September 14, 1862, it arrived at Nashville,
and took part in the battle of Stone’s River. It
did active duty in various locations until the date
of the battles around Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The Twelfth Wisconsin Battery was organized
and equipped at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. It
did service in both Tennessee and Mississippi until
coming to Chattanooga with General Sherman.</p>

<p>The Army of the Cumberland—as reorganized
prior to the battles around Chattanooga—with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
General Thomas in command, was now in permanent
possession of Chattanooga. The Confederate
Army took up its winter quarters at Dalton,
Georgia, on the railway twenty-eight miles southeast
of Chattanooga, across two mountain ranges.
The assignment of General Grant as commander
of the Division of the Mississippi—giving him
command of all the forces, operating in the States
of Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and
Mississippi—which so greatly contributed to the
victories in the battles around Chattanooga, insured
also the permanent holding of that city.</p>

<p>Whatever was accomplished by Rosecrans
during the four months of the campaign, beginning
on June 23 at Murfreesboro, and ending on
October 19, 1863 at Chattanooga, was done by
him and his Army of the Cumberland alone. He
could not get any cooperation from the East or
West. The President and General Halleck at
Washington, seemed to be in earnest by the wording
of their dispatches, as published in the <i>Rebellion
Record</i>, in urging and commanding Burnside
in east Tennessee and the Army of the Tennessee
on the Mississippi to join with Rosecrans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
prior to the battle of Chickamauga; for reasons
not apparent to the reader of present history, no
reinforcements came. It is pathetic to read the
official record of those days, which gives an account
of the struggles, the marches, the battles, the
sacrifices, the patient endurance by the musket
bearers of extreme fatigue, and the cheerfulness
with which the soldiers endured all. They
faced death without a thought of their real
heroism. To one who went through the campaign
and came out alive and unwounded it is incomprehensible,
that all did not die.</p>

<p>It is true other armies, such as those of the Potomac,
the Tennessee, and the one in Missouri had
campaigns at the same time and were equally
exposed to the hazards of war; but none of
them marched over a territory so mountainous
and so difficult; none of them fought battles
in so perilous a region or with more deadly
effect, than the soldiers in the battle of Chickamauga.
Had the Union Army been really defeated
and had it lost Chattanooga, the army
could hardly have recovered from the disaster,
without the quick aid of large reinforcements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
which were too far away at that time to be
available in an emergency. Burnside was besieged
at Knoxville, and the Army of the Tennessee
so far away, that it took weeks to get it
to Chattanooga. It will be of great interest to
the future student of the military history of the
War between the States to follow the subsequent
campaigns of the Western armies after Grant became
commander-in-chief, and Sherman was assigned
to the command in the West, with headquarters
at Chattanooga. He will apprehend how
all the armies worked together, and how soon the
rebellion itself was crushed, although its soldiers
fought to the bitter end.</p>
